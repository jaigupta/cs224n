You know what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or <unk> and no one has ever chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk about circles and <unk>
And you know a revelation, is usually something that fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle of <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the <unk>
When I took up to bleeding every week at the table of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He made it <unk>
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations who struggle against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never got to know us.
You could <unk> in Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to join you, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from his family, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today really talked about this.
It also needs dignity, and love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, it was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I took them around the water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was about a <unk> about another <unk> of snow after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or you break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to <unk> and hold down to the end, while others cannot <unk> more and <unk> in a <unk> of passionate <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As you melts, a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds in many forms of life.
I come to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't exist in that way.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few photos I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's recently actually going to come to see an iceberg <unk>
Here they go.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg out of a half a average size.
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is real time.
And so the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> OK.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about understanding it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined by chromosome X <unk>
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity at the ground at the end of two roles.
In one of my roles work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> for training and what I study in this case is the way people think of the anatomy -- these human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluids and the idea of the <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that I do in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into the male and conventional female programs.
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> so many ways.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't be <unk> in male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that become <unk>
And then in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to it.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops in a typically female.
And when you look at the baby it looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but does not have the menstrual stage, when someone realizes something is happening.
After making tests they realize that instead of <unk> <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's not really like that.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I think a woman <unk> doesn't know his structure, I think it's a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as a <unk> he had girlfriend, and his sex relationships with her, he had a life like a boy and I had just discovered that he had ovaries, and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had <unk> and the uterus was <unk> <unk> glands were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitalia was <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was the 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes -- what is known as <unk> -- they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are <unk> twins, or <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> surgery -- is not to be able to be able to take care of a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to several surgeries is that it's a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings us to make a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- it is a black thing to say to have any African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when we have a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very tight ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people inside a body.
The highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put it in trial his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to wonder, "What do you test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you about journalists who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we have to change the science, we have to admit that these categories -- we thought these categories were <unk> <unk> <unk> which are directly <unk> with <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than we <unk>
And not just in sex.
And also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology that comes in.
As we see, we get into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved into science we get increasingly into a <unk> zone where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to go through this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him got a pen in front of the nose and they were still not <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a prisoner's dilemma really death -- and that puts us in a difficult situation in which we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, I claim people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
You know, these categories are much more fragile than we thought about me.
It will be <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so sweeping into what they did, I find every so much of seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain why.
What they <unk> was a concept of <unk> and <unk> it with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And like all of you remember, what our <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was coming into political power by the rights of blood transmitted from the grandfather and then the father and then and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replace it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the history of the <unk> <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from Natural <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a <unk> idea of birth <unk>
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And so we were passing through the idea of <unk> coincidence.
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future women's rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened then?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement came with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights Movement and saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that were going to <unk> the <unk> difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Civil Movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights for a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to forget about anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I went on June 1 1980.
Henry, at the other hand, was born in term: 9/11 was born.
For the fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all of the rights three months before Henry <unk> the right to sex consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, Henry, virtue of being a man -- if I don't tell you if it is <unk> by virtue of being man being <unk> now is <unk> of <unk> <unk> who Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on his hand, doesn't have the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science gets us.
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at a moment has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have chromosome -- and to marry a woman you have to have <unk> Y.
Now, in practice they don't make tests of the people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in color of their skin, but on the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks like this.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be interested in this to inspire rights to people, because I will admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and smart people about their sexual relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of <unk> content.
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
So we've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian when a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless you're willing to submit to a sex change, in which case you can make it live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had made light twins and then they would take them back to it.
But when the phone asked her the reason for the <unk> operation, a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered the political <unk> instead of the separation of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be <unk> to change the good state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we had gotten greater participation into <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different from different <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
For years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to the complex social relationships and take care of those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered a feminist, as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is women's <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with violating the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about his question, more I think there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the male brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if you look at them, they were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that, if you put more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we think about democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily put it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd that if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just ran out by buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments would be <unk> and that the other half is still <unk> to do it.
You could try to increase the ability by <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around them have rules to avoid the lengths and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, and build a building of apartments completely new, and when the rules of that place would be able to build the construction instead of putting it together.
So I proposed that governments would have new reform zones to hold cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
And in the next regular <unk> <unk> <unk> made it <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
And through a process of <unk> trial and error and a large number of testing with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, as those rules that say you can't go and join all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies for <unk> and usually that is the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They call.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you about this point about valuable cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City. I mean, in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was quite a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was one pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk that I was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which will make the rules out there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go and not live under those norms.
So President of <unk> I called me and told me that we had to do this project, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
I was asked to go to <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This is just this airport to cover over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, we have to start with a site that is about one that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 <unk>
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The team of Congress came up to the platform, and he said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of <unk> <unk>
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained what it was like that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could go in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from countries -- they could benefit from countries that would help them establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could be trusted.
We went and we saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that could create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
By <unk> in the Constitution -- you have to pass twice as well.
On February 17, he passed again in another voting again from <unk> to one.
After the voting after the voting on the 21st of February, a delegation of 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in city construction.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city which is being built in Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything that you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years to get the <unk>
The other country was interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing his Supreme Court to be the ultimate court system for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that have already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job, sometimes they are unique mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a confession inside, and that's what I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find alive, and more recently, photographing and post in my blog and colorful colorful and different to each time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is <unk> of <unk> markets, and <unk> stores.
Ah, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I'm going to know people who are <unk> usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does someone have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I found.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> inside exactly a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I would like to wear after you got to Palm <unk>
And because you don't know me as the woman walking at TED in <unk>   That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the <unk> for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You almost always see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I used in the week.
<unk> is energy power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just <unk> you will tell you.
<unk> <unk> of the child in the inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their <unk>
I like to talk to you and say, <unk>
<unk> The trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and the outside, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth, six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and only one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously, this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, and I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> and <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I came up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, the right side.
So if you put a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a plane of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> from one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing you can just be in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing on a parking bar.
I was a little boy and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet play with that bar in a parking lot, taught a precious lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except that you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics a few years earlier, you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not really good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it also doesn't look good at my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be on the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't work.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see it's been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a very big zoom in the small metal <unk>
What we see is a small piece of metal, with a springboard and that stands over on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
So for the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming form of swimming in the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up with I stop doing those things, because I don't want them to do it, or actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues on the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind going on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then you get it to an temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, if you're just going to be in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act as possible.
So we measured their movements.
We found that he moved in very strange forms.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way he <unk> it was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that becomes and <unk>
And by giving you a smooth thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you, is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that a thing that is <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which is what it means that the whole metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worthwhile <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is roughly the same than the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you possibly too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that you talk about.
So imagine if they were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights up, and we looked at the box, we saw the metal still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly seemingly all the objects on the elevator in reality are only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims it's all interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months and so on.
And so many negotiations and stories, it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explained to simply this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
And so when I started traveling and go to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
So better than show the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done since his launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there there.
There's the gallery <unk> at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you <unk>
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We open up the flat plane, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the desk.
You go forward. That <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click out here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million the pixels.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to look at it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
And I went in, and I found that kids were actually playing something.
And I was just a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is a <unk> with a stick with a Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday other.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep in deep and you'll see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little perspective, I'm going to move the picture, so you'll see what it is.
So here we were, and this is a painting.
Best is for coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to look at the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this work <unk>
It goes up and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things over here, but I don't have time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, you send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these masterpieces <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media does justice to your artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
In our lab we call it intelligent design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian -- all the kids in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened really something very interesting in the racing careers in the last two decades.
A long time ago, if you wanted to win a budget of Formula 1, take a budget and give it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering -- you have real real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting back to the open.
And as a <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I wanted to say that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and even 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be something big.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the late summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms would become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old <unk> dream of <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he said that at the end took the hammer -- and he threw it on the Moses -- -- -- you can still see a little dent in <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and that's why not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push something out.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember -- they played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The line is on the top.
By the late early days there are people over here, and there are <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> in France. <unk> in Italy.
<unk> people do a quick call.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, Yes!
That night they were all <unk> to the center.
You see the great summit.
The next day they went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world is <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the <unk> <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and we use.
Today, we know all about the origins of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, then we put a little bit, one tag on the trash and then start <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that before not exist.
There are complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> it doesn't have to be somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we drop on a day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is driving over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology technology, new technology, come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves and you get open and <unk>
It creates a <unk> <unk> with pixels of water.
If the pixels fall out there can be written in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And the curtain will open up so that we can turn it as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
I liked it very much.
And we got a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows, but when you come up with it is open so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be someone, in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when almost all the entire architecture is gone.
This is working.
You see people <unk> so it goes into it.
And here I am myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way we could interact with a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to leave you -- but a building that was still making <unk> and <unk> and one had to jump into <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, we always think of the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to thinking about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the Earth.
You can play it with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, where you can get close, and you can see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an entrance that comes from people, the movement of people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of death today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D, and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left, you see the <unk> it capture the <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as a motion capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go through the way.
And once we have the pixels to play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment <unk> like an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of us <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We have <unk> everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama Obama campaign, we can move from the digital world of <unk> power to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the ground.
It's a physical structure in London, but cover from the ground.
You can move inside, you can have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only a changes in their genes, they could improve <unk> for a more accurate and more fast.
Or maybe you would like to be in better form, will be stronger, having more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure themselves?
How about living more <unk>
Or maybe it's those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is you going to tell you.
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> You probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you chose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's only imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or about us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here a few <unk> years.
It may seem that we are very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like the human insulin but it's the same protein, which is what comes out of the pancreatic tissue.
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the intestine.
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> give them the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's hot hot, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that you can want without effort in their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with occasional disruption in some hasten and <unk>
But at all, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would we tell us the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as only one and unique <unk> and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to two daughters cells.
But when organisms come from? Things begin to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens to the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to say that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, every time was <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits her door in a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him finds a magnificent dancer.
He looks at him and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the objective of the <unk> not necessarily just differently.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to get the health in the disease.
I wanted we to live more and much more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as <unk> rockets that are designed to send the genetic load to the next level, and then let us fall to sea.
I think that all of us <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily promote longevity.
It doesn't necessarily promote the biggest or the strongest or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That is the only survival test.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would have to, if there were fish there, fish -- fish <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward, to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the developmental reasoning, would be that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we get into ourselves as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional kind of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a kind of <unk> planets are going to exist by isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility -- an intriguing and intriguing possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
Let's first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it takes on the individual and family level.
Think about that if it could be possible to choose not only sex in their <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
There is not a lot of people to make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more to the reach of all.
You come to those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us, but they will induce herd against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine that is grown into cells from a <unk> plant.
Can you imagine something good out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, to remove the diabetes, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that is that the very engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also allow us to adopt a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a faster muscle muscle than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why would not live longer?
This is going to be compelling.
And when we are in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of <unk>
We're going to take a process that I could normally take 100,000 years and we can send it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren in their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options in advance of a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or are we going to selectively selectively assume different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 meter tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would take the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and without noises.
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words you've heard of.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight worker.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. It was <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all of the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking later on, I came up with a phrase, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to hear anything in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington Bridge that was not very much -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've been trying to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also led to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that I don't care with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have no reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please help me."
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I was born, I had the feeling of, I think that I would die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to hear me, I love my life.
And that sadness would be <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small kid.
And for me, that was all reason to be in the world.
At that point I understood when we connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle of not dying that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and to live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens to your airplane -- and please not be that -- but you can imagine, and how do you take it?
What do you mean that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live through <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many different projects.
But the greatest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the start of ALS.
<unk> has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so that, obviously, graffiti is <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and reunited with her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he is able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you get somebody important and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Somebody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're making it with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented myself with the only desire to deliver a check and instead he signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I committed to his brother and his father there at that very very moment -- "OK, this is the <unk> Tony goes to speak, and we're going to find a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have so much on their inner cannot be able to <unk>
So I talked about a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research -- Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw about that and record negative space.
So they go through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot of organization and so much move things back to a couple of things.
One, touch the gates of insurance companies and get a machine that <unk> could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call <unk> because when I talk to the guy with an email you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the surrounding world of all parts of the corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage, and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and when they would have taken the pictures from the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks -- we went to the shipping tour, my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of <unk> sun glasses that we bought on the shipping <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we set it up on an LED light and now there's a device that's free -- and it's a device that is free -- and you put the code on the process of the software being low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say <unk>
There is no hospital to say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the next person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after a year of planning, two weeks of planning, two weeks of programming, Tony sessions.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a movie on a parking wall outside of the hospital.
And he turned to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been underwater and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out there so that I could <unk>
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our scream at war.
That's what keeps us in the movement, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've gained lots of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were from the guy, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the greatest <unk> of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all this is -- and this is what ends up closing the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible the stage, the computer, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with technology recognition technology -- I just recognized something and I was excited by wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel that you need to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years ago in situations often very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It's in <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance, with the only goal to try to look at social questions in ways that we have to do interesting -- interesting -- and, hopefully analyzing them in a way that would be fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I learned that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard -- or not, a couple of weeks ago, I got a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered them to sell the rights on the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content might be in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good opportunity to go.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago I wouldn't have been able to tell you for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could make me <unk> anything so difficult or as dangerous as I go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I tried to deal with product -- products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in the biggest movie ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, at first end, has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> which appears before the title -- the X.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> to <unk> them forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what?
I'm a <unk> <unk>
He was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X brand in the title but we're going to make sure that we're going to make any of the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe it would take a shoe and becomes the greatest shoe that you've got to <unk>
The biggest car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink you've got from "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea full of film, it will end.
And I would love you to help me make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive the people are going to be at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: One million and a half million <unk> <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting with them, but it certainly will be worth convincing a couple of big scales.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out to us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So, I want help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk>
MK: We have to think of what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he goes, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these suddenly disappeared.
No want to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of <unk> media is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had an error <unk> and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for images from <unk> in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that appeared.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of the information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the CEOs -- the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that rare bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want it to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want <unk> <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie in some lie in a lie -- and there's him looking at me as he used to say, "Son, are three sides in every story.
There's your story, there's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this filmed we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency, wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to get out to my mind, I would have to take out the middle and go to the companies that I had all over my team.
So what I started to warn you all of a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant <unk> and others who make small films like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies, they say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you will see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "You're nice to this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want to help you that you get <unk>
Maybe you should put yourself a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like it.
That's the overall look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are more <unk>
So we don't have the budget that other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, reminding you to <unk> people is why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
<unk> technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something sexy. <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps cool.
How do you keep you fresh longer? With better <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me to the regular <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: Oh, my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, lots of gray colors and things like that.
They generally wear accessories like sunglasses, or <unk> and the same way.
Woman: If Dan was a brand like a brand <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In a part of it in a <unk> part of <unk> -- I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because it was <unk>
Man 5: <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a brand <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to make it, but I often get involved in the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they could do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> from that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we are, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come back and start in a place and in my case come back and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: Next is this was the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your form of be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be.
I like the different things.
I like <unk> I like weird things.
A: <unk> for what does it serve us?
What's the <unk> What phase is <unk>
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
It was a little bit about that.
<unk> more than you, which is not who you are.
What other other <unk> have you <unk>
You know, you have to be afraid of what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: because of your patience. <unk> Big <unk> A: Yes. Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy all over this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but <unk> in your <unk> personality, <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other marks are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and brands -- those things that have gone and come and come up with a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: This is a <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to hold your brand identity, your brand brand of brand, what would it be?
You're a representative attribute you're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you rather a representative attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes attributes are like being playful as being playful like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical as <unk>
Or are you rather than <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
Are you a traditional place, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, a stable, stable, reliable, <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who were saying <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire as much for commercial marketing centers as a movie for.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the schools with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or where I've had more success are those in the ones I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make the people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They were success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press, no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talked about to help their customers be part of it.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out of the people that's pushing the failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss of being preparing their whole company to reward them for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to us is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to animate people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, going forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is going to be <unk>
From one <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than just a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies all over the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which was exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on behalf of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my own TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus virus used by a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box -- then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> entered the gray box, <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started researching <unk> it was six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these boxes <unk> these control systems.
That really struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had a <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
And so they were very strange.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat that he didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we say, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than the goal will soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack code, and we found that I was <unk> in two pumps -- a small small and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed very professionally armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They took all of the points to attack.
You probably even know how much it was going to be <unk>
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me say, <unk> is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this <unk> code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much as old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning, they were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to engage with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> and it's probably a <unk> white and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort by <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that small part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and put it into an obvious attempt to make the nest engineers crazy.
We tried to decipher the big digital <unk> by looking at the data and the structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> out in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in their hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from it after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> would look at one and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about the other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just looked at me.
There is the gray box and the top is <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values of sensors for example, of the sensors of pressure and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data data.
And believe it or not, these false entry data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera, you feed video <unk>
It's great enough.
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the <unk> in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the great steam turbine goes through speed, you need to open up heart valves in a <unk>
And obviously this cannot be a human operator, of course.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> <unk> of uranium.
It could also work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have about <unk> <unk> that disseminate this load of <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
We will make the most possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than let's start doing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My mind is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give <unk> abilities or another that makes users of wheelchair get up and come back again.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force, which also increases its speed, and helps you for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connecting it with the universe and other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier that, on average, should take on their back, a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to bring up even more equipment.
Obviously this leads to some minor complications -- injuries on your back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or the <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can spend 90 kilos on the ground for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put it in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and a <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the look at the users of the wheels, what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in wooden chairs.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people with damage in the spine that when their life will start -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall, and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that gets older.
Her only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the column, and as a result, he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a little bit of sensors.
It was completely not <unk> on crutches that send signals on your computer board here on the back.
There are also some batteries that give power to engines in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it go through this very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing down there was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all the feeling and all the motion of bone <unk>
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said to me, <unk> you will never get to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it to the last amount of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it is down to <unk> climbing rocks and even <unk> in a hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change your life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of the wooden chairs all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival, <unk> Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the forests of Congo.
<unk> are, along with chimpanzees, their closest relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
While the chimps are dominated by the big guys, <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where death violence has not yet been.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been <unk> for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation makes it not fill in a stadium with the bonobos that have in the world -- and honestly we are not sure that.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden by <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have frequent sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the world's life is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their life.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't mention practice.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case to him love it, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common as much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to come up with this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water with no kind of water.
I think that we sometimes play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world of creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But do we go to the maximum our <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
And for Bonobos for the same, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems like the least appropriate appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which the most <unk>
So fellow primates, let's take this gift of evolution and try together together as I <unk> creativity, and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty <unk> fires fires as a captain assistant in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are commissioned by highly <unk> staff you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career to stand against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to go back and would save the dog, of the owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I walked into a flying building to save a live building to save a living of five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of <unk>
I was <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, and I went to the fire firemen that at that height or less had finished off the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back into the ladder where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
<unk> of the house, the treasures of home where, as it was to wait, your trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> for the courageous effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at was that someone had ever reached a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling at Robin <unk> as my calling for voluntary firefighter is a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also the acts of grace and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have succeeded, or they're going to make remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: You don't know.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
You know, food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
Are they mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's lives, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you go to the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the particular block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules from cement from a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
And he was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they have made more than 400 billion or 75 buildings per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the labs, Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create a much bigger and more complex circuits a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think of it as the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is linked by magnets.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the road, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue with a green one, very quickly you can start to make larger circuits.
A blue one with green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or slower. Just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an extra collection there.
We want all of the interactions in the world to sit down to building blocks ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given the kids to watch them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand electronic electronics every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light bulb works, or why the door of an elevator is being open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
So here you can see, with paper bottles, we have <unk> <unk>
So a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the U.S. School designers of Rhode Island -- who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a cannon cannon on motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go to the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company <unk> to get involved in the environment.
Digital collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
We can continue to keep the video up to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm already term time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
I took some members every year, and we put them to work with <unk>
Instead of getting them to the Third World we send them to the wild world <unk>
They did great <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> to <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
So here it appears as if I would look at a date, but what you really find is that somebody else has caught up by the snow, because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter in snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at the time that was very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it made as any good programmer, I developed an application.
It's a nice app that you can take for a <unk>
You pick up <unk> when you <unk>
By doing so, you put a name, in this case, he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the youngest of 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology in the government <unk>
It spreads into viral form.
A responsible responsible system is responsible for systems of <unk> to see this app that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> tsunami, but people steal batteries.
So he asks the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just launched it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has spread out of <unk> in organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that that had done by the normal channels would have taken it at least two and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California <unk> that the moment has cost 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of governance.
So an application that shows up in a couple of days and viral broadcast is a kind of a shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the world's best ways to work, not as the private companies as many people think it should be.
Nor do a technological company, but also as well as the Internet itself.
That is, without constraints, in the way open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They've not given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration that you know, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they put us nuts, the government is, in essence, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because it alone doesn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have been <unk>
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made out of -- remember that from <unk> <unk> The way to think about it is going to affect the way that change.
I didn't know much of the government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the telephone and information phone center.
It's the place that calls calls if you brand <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> This phone call.
He said, <unk> in the official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open your gates on the house, put music hard and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a phone center.
It has a web application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really gets this <unk> <unk> in my bucket -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do that for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I come up with the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to the collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technology on the platform.
I talk about a platform for people to join and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
attached to two people.
And it could be connected with government services, but the next neighbor is a better alternative and cheapest than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, it will be <unk>
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a leader <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will evolve our values and <unk> our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the <unk> superficial layer.
It's below what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps us that we have, that we essentially have something that operates in our against, that one thing, and we are losing the power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy out of it.
Because that's where the real job of governance.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the motion <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> in the government, it's time for us to ask what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't afford government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I was a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to speak, everyone will talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when they face the government problem, they don't really care a lot about their voices.
They're using their hands.
They set up the work to program for applications that make a better job to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking away a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me an actual honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities that are involved in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has about identity.
And the things that you say here are impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was <unk> it was power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little boy, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me, and he said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was going to tell me again, and if I said yes, I was leaving in peace.
He had this human quality that I would always want to want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight to nine years, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
So I looked at her and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, I went through the room, he took me out of my hand, and said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I never forget.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know that. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you like."
I never forget.
Then he said to me, I just want you to give me three things: <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to think about is that we always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, I think I'm going to do it."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to think about is that you're always going to be the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I was like, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do it."
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to think about is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, I think I'm going to do it."
I grew up in the field, in South America, I have a brother older and sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took us out of my sister and me and went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk> of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, you know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk>
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I went up with a force and it <unk> "Oh, it won't be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is getting <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I'm saying it by power that has identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense of it.
We can't get to do things that don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases with alcohol.
And these were the things that according to her, we had to have a <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There is 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One of every three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail, in jail, or a parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, South Philadelphia, Pakistan, of 50 to 60 percent of all young men are in jail, in jail, in jail for parole.
Our system is not just distorted in the face of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is wealth that affects the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and the anger is made us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work -- some of the things that are quite curious.
In my state, in Alabama, well as in other states, you care about rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the black population of black male has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years, the level of loss of being as high as it was before you get the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it was sentence of 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without any chance of getting out.
Now we're in process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> to people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way of how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death in America is defined by error.
In every nine people <unk> has identified one that is innocent and liberated from the death row.
There was an innocent rate of error, an innocent rate.
This is interesting.
In aviation would not be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine of them, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get ourselves to the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding of the reconstruction of the rebuilding of the World War I.
We really don't know much about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was an amazing time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
There are now older people who come to me and say, <unk> Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> people who stop saying that in our own history for the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was left of <unk> and decades of <unk> racial <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we would do with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about race, I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome the segregated <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know that it's very disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> There's no death penalty in Germany.
We can never be able to be here."
The room was silent, and a lady said, "There's no way to have our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we were going to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't do it.
Would that be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
It was fascinated by technology.
We love the entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both.
lately we talk about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that will never come to TED.
Think about them is, in some ways, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational so committed to the intellectual,
And development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the heart.
This connection of your mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how dark and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering out we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in the communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect <unk> with technology and design, that allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay enough attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts are a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, as a young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> We are going to get together to speak.
You want to come and do it.
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she would say, "Well, and what are you going to do when I <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I went and just just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, let me tell me what this idea of justice justice is.
I know what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom <unk> for kids.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> put my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to figure out how to deal with those challenges, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't love it, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law.
I also think in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
This is it.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves for our technology, for our designs, not because of our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end it is going to be given the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich and powerful people, but the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas are beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I look at my clients of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody who isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
And one very late night, I was lying <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer was treated as a senior <unk> executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there have been that there have been <unk> behavior in <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there's no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> but I'd sent it to court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally I said, "Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came up with the car.
I was going up the stairs when I met with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who are you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I was <unk> and I was <unk>
And I took care of you in the ear, though.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was linked to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> And I started argue.
People started to go. Everyone was <unk>
I was that I had written those <unk>
They got the policemen <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people, everybody worried because we're talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and learn to hear all that <unk>
I kept walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man, with the face of a concern, he walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> I showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the operating room.
And the old black man stood up and looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man who keeps her view in the objective of <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot truly be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and the dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I simply want to tell you that they keep eye on the objective of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> of hearing and seeing an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to deal with the funds that we spend in politics today.
For example, here in California, you spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> in the case of homicide in homicide in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, for safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it is that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong War on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we let ourselves convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into a bicycle chain, to steal a bicycle for small crimes against property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you excited to be <unk> here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that media media prefer to use negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses is getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing else, it matters more than survive, the first stop -- is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us.
And so from a <unk> of histories <unk> looking at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's a blood -- it's really true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what is really happening is we received <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the extinction of species, the water extinction and <unk> we certainly have <unk>
As humans are really good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita adjusted for inflation has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has reduced child mortality 10 times.
Also, the cost of the food, of transportation and transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
Many people forget.
And we continue to spend the <unk>
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, moving air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It was very much about this technology and lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that was involved in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the price of the price on about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the smooth thing that is -- at good and bad time, in war and peace, we <unk> in depression and at the rise.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is in <unk>
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends from <unk> call infinite computing sensors and networks, and 3D printing -- 3D printing -- 3D printing -- 3D printing -- 3D printing -- 3D printing -- 3D printing -- vaccines -- vaccines and food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory at "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was voluntary.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> to aging.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, that is available for every single cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, does not mean creating life <unk> for each <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of how possible.
It's about to take that that's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the mid century.
He's the kind of the left.
They went to dinner with the <unk> king of <unk>
The troops were consumed with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk> aluminum
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure chemicals.
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
I will take this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the fact that the produced of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the late decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electric power will cost six cents a hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan wrote the Voyager spacecraft towards the Earth, in 1990, after he passed away.
So let's put a very famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A pale spot.
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is water water, two percent ice is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology that's available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I was allowed to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a refrigerator refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any <unk> water, saltwater, contaminated water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just assumed that I'm going to make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which this will be, Coca-Cola will implement it globally in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an important innovation that is driven by this technology.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smart phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communication that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video, images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best comes to the health of the health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we get these technologies into a mobile device that you talk about, and because it has <unk> you can get the blood out of your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> load is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this <unk> device, a RNA virus or the DNA that I don't mean to call the health care and, first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the brand seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give to the world of education and health care.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, we have been at less than two billion people.
By 2020, it goes from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What <unk> What wishes <unk>
And instead of economic collapse -- we'll have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computation into the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and power for the first time?
What about these 3,000 million?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small teams -- guided by their passion with an objective of course, they can do things <unk> things that could only make large corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
We slept at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the <unk>
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem with <unk>
They've played with this university professors and among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and began <unk>
And it has been shown that today the recognition machinery machinery is better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative thing.
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we get focused on to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very intriguing idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that he was <unk> but it wasn't.
They actually pick fish.
And it described to one of them as <unk>
It was the <unk>
He stuck it so much to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still say they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: about the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some mangroves.
There was <unk> of about 20 percent, the black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so you made more than half in Ghana.
When I went there, 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped down in half.
<unk> at five centimeters.
It was a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing is changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- it's called <unk> 4.
I went out to fishing in it, and we did studies in the south of China Sea, and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals in the background.
And most of the fish are these tiny spots on the <unk> remains that are fish from coral reef.
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a living alive.
I wasn't still <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what collected the fishermen every time they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world but we don't remember.
It will give you the starting point to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis we have <unk> biodiversity, lots of whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images to start at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing, and we extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the terms of changes.
And at the end of the end, I keep the remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before it is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose rare animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain such as a captain like Captain such and maybe watched a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally don't use the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge paper that can fulfill a protected area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has been running and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine zone and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it, because they don't have access, like the West Bank, for example?
I think there the arts and cinema can maybe fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the harbor bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk>
Because it raises something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to <unk> making <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager and look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are made virus and what importance to it.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something really, really difficult.
But today, the website makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of the percentage gets viral gets lots and lots of visits and wins <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> communities of participation and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this film outside of his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This chart shows the <unk> at the rise of popularity last summer.
<unk> wasn't supposed to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk>
That's what you do if you call <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this question that <unk> the video to <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present to us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants you to get a weekend, the weekend.
<unk> of Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
It was almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be coming out of anything.
So what happened this day?
Well, he was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to do a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or an creators group are taking on a point of view, and they share it with a broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great <unk> <unk> then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th entertainment century of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a repetitive animation with a music <unk>
So that's it.
This year they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a <unk> version of the last four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old one.
And then it was made up.
All of a sudden, a whole community came up with that would happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Barack Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you script could have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video you go up with two days of video per minute, just the only thing and unexpected can be done in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in much.
Casey <unk> It <unk> me not circular by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you completely properly from the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> I made five million you saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new thing that we do differently.
And all of this leads us to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> in creative communities of participation, the completely unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- a new culture that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They weren't allowed to express your ideas.
Now we are all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're barely the current media -- but it will save the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the single hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come in <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much <unk> <unk> now <unk>
It <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried <unk> but <unk>
So the next part of the puzzle is about a boat to dawn <unk> turning into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls in it.
For her, life was destined to be <unk> the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that it challenges the fiction, a boat went into the sea just dressed up from <unk> ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was <unk> rape and death.
As most adults, my mother carried a <unk> with poison.
If we were going to look at first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine -- the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and vacuum.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to pluck for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform, in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I wanted, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrant
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of <unk> <unk> are traded among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, <unk> turn.
Even so, I found time to study English and get a title in IT from <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they had an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what was <unk> who usually was <unk> <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> about our day and listening to the motions of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the ship.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then he studied to be <unk> and he opened up another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make <unk> angry and <unk> and kids -- trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student <unk> with what he <unk> myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected the young Australian <unk>
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges of not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> of <unk> was now <unk> <unk> and social activist and invited to speak in places I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence she had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire into the routines. And the happy life of life on a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters and two daughters and two daughters and two daughters <unk> the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> the day on the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age as she had when we got the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you can't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more I was talking, the more I was talking about to talk about.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of as possible.
And even though I finished my work, I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new thing in the scene -- and not only that it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, an <unk> optimism, a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people for who the motto cannot <unk> it was an infectious challenge.
For one year, we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant <unk> of soup that all <unk>
They were going to get to entry at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
It took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My God!
Three months later I had <unk> and adventure <unk>
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and taking the cause, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
The can't make it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the hotel room in <unk> when she killed 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell us stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given those of us and how life <unk> us now we can see that the men who have come to our lives would have <unk> us.
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might like that for you?
But I fear the privilege of easy, on the right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a courageous one in each wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and look at it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today, in the fourth or <unk>
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under <unk> <unk> with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was <unk> the great prince warrior of Indian warrior Indian, he pulled a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was struck me very much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was looking at this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't make my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic to let it not kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his silver <unk>
And this <unk> technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it from it.
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, instead of killing her.
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device that could connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
You bring the text together with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that do for us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And this --  He says, "This box belongs to me. I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments, I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons but that magic magic is to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned out to me.
So over here, we need to rebuild the iPad to unlock fireflies.
And really, they light your way into what subtraction in the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by as a child was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a <unk> that I <unk> towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In the whole book of fantasy there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another important aspect of me is creating Indian content and contemporary again.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people out of India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> <unk>
That's why we're bringing them back in a childhood story.
In a story that deals with current issues as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they have not come out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do that.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter -- a photo to a flower and then <unk>
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A boy from London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the contrast of connection between magic and Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we need to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through it through and through augmented reality. I see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and pick it up to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will be driven by technology and magic and technology come to each other.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic and joy and child love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What's going on?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they were failing because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> on and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I approached me, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> physician has access to him as well. So he can see what's my problem of weight, not at the same time that he needs <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's actually pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also to make patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to lie from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to control of control and will be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face as the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
And you know, techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did would like to share it with you with a video.
We all have navigation checks in <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are in <unk>
And where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the <unk> closest to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to look at the audience -- you see a <unk> please try to look at it, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and other are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone -- and at the next few weeks to use your cell phone to find the closest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish we were <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that they would help us find, work and act as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also like to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You might be messaging services or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is still in their place.
Please stop in this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph woke up with my first digital camera to 15 years.
It was mixed with my passion before, but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very crowded road.
But it has a twist on it.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can imagine, but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them sound real.
It's the details or the <unk>
I would think of light?
What creates <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end is our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about realistic as it is realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly dramatic objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined, in some way you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if we exist.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're those in which they don't even <unk> things around us in our everyday life.
But by combining photographs is very important, because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are played with these <unk> they made the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect joint.
It has to be impossible to see where the image <unk>
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And I think it's easier to create a place that remains because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even did red the house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So in order to get an realistic result: I think it takes planning.
You always start with an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here each piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please do you <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details -- but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of dramatic microprocessors versus power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are you <unk> curves on the technological scales.
The answer is that if the draw in a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to tell you, the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look at it, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve -- it would be a very silly line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation <unk> as fast as we might take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development of growth that every few years ago orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- look at these <unk> curves we see they don't forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve -- I know like this until something totally comes up with something completely different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new shape.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way that you take <unk>
How new state is going the world?
The transition looks very, very confused if we are engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference that people talk about the future and we see that the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
We can feel a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that we extrapolate what we are doing today.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at the long-term things.
The scale of time when I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two and a half billion years old when the Earth was a huge <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals that we were walking around.
If we look at the way that chemicals <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is, at that time, I had floating through some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside its inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and the blobs grew up grew up grew up grew up.
And they started to divide.
In a sense, those were the most mature cell forms that those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time it was <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we get.
So every drop was a little different.
In fact, the blobs that somehow become better at being better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> more chemicals and more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things become interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> learned to store information.
They learn to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a system of writing that allowed them to register what they were in order to do it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved and billions of years.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same <unk>
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the security security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants a hundred million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would have taken it out in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells become happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things get very different, and that was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information to form that cell cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of <unk> to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that in a way, were together in a way, and a <unk>
So it <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community becoming more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so much to come up so much that they came together and decided to write all the recipe from the community board in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use the heart, or the muscles.
So these communities evolved and they produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not making more than processing information in community.
These are neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those individual cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures to understand and convey the information.
Those are the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism can, for example, learning not to eat some of the fruit, because I knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures greatly accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea in my head.
I'm here sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated and we made it sound in sound, in sound sequences, and we make something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to begin to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to do abstractions.
Now we went through similar periods to organisms that are <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
So the <unk> computer tape -- the video tape -- the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we do before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which there was some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales.
The first stages of history that I told you took a billion years each.
The next few days, the nervous system and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And beyond, as electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent <unk>
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with designers of <unk> <unk> we think a level of abstraction, put it on the machine, and the machine with that does something that was not could, it becomes much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "By the computer, you can run a hundred million pieces of instructions to chance?
You could run these instructions of instructions at random, running all those programs, and you will take those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that get closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
I got those and <unk> to the rest.
And now <unk> the best to ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that children will take the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Let's go back again.
So let's put some mutations in.
And it tries to bring it back and forth with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated, hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that orders an absolutely perfect way.
In fact, they're very efficient programs that I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried <unk> to see how they work.
These are dark programs -- strangers.
But do they get <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I once went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and pull out a card and say, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
Yet we don't understand the whole choices that we are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so being able to run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the heck we are creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent the time enough to give me a part of my <unk> <unk> in that.
Before I tried to deal with my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about <unk> <unk> talk about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you have a know.
It's called average <unk>
And we're talking about 300 of a <unk> that we were striving for.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of the game without being <unk> and anybody who tried to launch it to the first base, it doesn't get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody than 10 cents <unk> 4.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the Women's League of <unk> in doing more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and it comes into a surgeon that has also a <unk> record record.
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a place away and a dear person has two <unk> <unk> <unk> and your family doctor derives from <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better on this year.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you believe is the average of hits a heart surgeon or a <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is send them to the world, and I would include the mandate to be perfect.
That never, ever made a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a partner in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> was a <unk>
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the residence of nurses at the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and your heart work, the <unk> of each artery that comes out of the <unk> physical diagnosis and not regular <unk>
And I even knew the physical diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of medical school with the impression that if we were going to make everything -- or most possible that you can close to all the way -- because I'm going to tell you about mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto when they brought the lady in the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was able to go to a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist and attend that patient.
I report to the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a sound of <unk> sound on both sides, which was given to me an heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of <unk> blood forward, and blood will go to your lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
He gave him <unk> pills of water, so that I could get rid of it.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent him to his house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring some information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made that was worse.
When they send it to her home, he didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner saying, <unk> it's not a good idea. I don't think so.
In fact, I was so confident that I was so confident that I asked the nurse that he <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the tall, the ambulance along with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I went to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. So I did something I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency emergency service of the way home.
And there another nurse, who <unk> from the lady <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists fear it also, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients themselves.
So the three words are -- you remember this?
"He remembers the patient sent to her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
By the end of an hour to have come home, after I had the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the emergency room with 50 millimeter <unk> which means a shock of <unk>
I barely breathe and there was blue.
The emergency staff of emergency.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> until the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and hoped against every hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days or three days, it was clear that I never had.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> what was happening.
And at ninth day, they let him go. Mrs. <unk> mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks began, I was amazed at it, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and sat by myself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't touch them with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
Is that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that worked.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was an <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take things out and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made an error so <unk>
Why I chose medicine?
Little on that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in one day, he opened up the sky and finally came out to me if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was trying to make the efforts to be perfect for not to make any more mistakes, I would stop those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in his throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him to her house.
But while he ran to the door he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> <unk> my boss asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he went back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, we don't know.
<unk> antibiotics <unk> antibiotics and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> of the emergency <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation in it.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys -- but it was normal.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He made a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk>
I looked at it, and when you saw some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered recovered well.
But every case I was looking at me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here is the problem: If I can't get to talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard about failure, after what, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> you have difficulty looking at it at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes, and the ones that will not sleep and the ones that I know, those who have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost as an antibody reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you go out of medicine to the people that make mistakes, we're going to get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and journalism -- I've done a personal study of bad medical malpractice and medical failures to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote to Toronto, from the first article that I wrote to Toronto, and my <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes happen every single day in which one in 10 drugs are going to be wrong, or <unk> is not right, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where infection infections are increasingly <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this country, 24,000 <unk> are killed by <unk> <unk>
The U.S. Institute of Medicine established 100,000.
In both cases, it is about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's how things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge goes up every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
And sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow them to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain and come up with eyes <unk> and with breath in alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get together, and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, you don't get anybody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art, art -- it's a tendency to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> to go down your head and eat saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You could say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, you know, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it starts to learn from what happened to teach others.
They had their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not intend to <unk> but in a love and support and support for everybody <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, let's make mistakes.
And I feel so much, but I get to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And recently, I made a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says, pick an American American, be about 70 to day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research followed by a week to a group of presidents came.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks by these executives and the time that we would make decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs every week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your elections.
You know how many people belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How do you get the way that deals with those <unk>
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to the business overload.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I am blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise when I ask a question, if your answer is positive -- please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this level of level very, very <unk> at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 of the <unk> water -- and this was when you take water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked myself, why do I never buy nothing?
This is a shelf on the oil shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees <unk>
I once decided to go to the manager and I asked him, "You know, this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different different classes.
He took a <unk> right to the shop.
We put out <unk> of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop stopping the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From the ones that stopped when I had <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
The ones that stood when there was six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably want to make sure -- less is good to keep <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices are affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even though this doesn't look at us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funding offers in savings plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had plans that went from two to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of money <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in plans that have two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went down to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate as much as the number of choices, more people are becoming helpful to avoid stocks or hedge funds.
And as soon as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we engage to optimize human financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that it makes the decision, that the <unk> even though this is going to go against the interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less likely to do -- even though I may hardly go better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that whole range of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test in their businesses.
The first one is <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're looking at is actually looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut, you get rid of <unk> options, there's going to be a <unk> increase in sales, there'll be a better experience in the choice.
When we <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> they eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that fewer <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and less costs.
You know that the supermarket supermarket today, on average are 45,000 products.
In a grocery store there are about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world now is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the business of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have come up on how to drive better choices is David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safe background of life.
People who really want to choose to, you have 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> to ask the differences that there are among those choices.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do their <unk>
This evening, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people from this audience on a holiday with all paid to the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause.
<unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not <unk>
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first turn, which in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the business overload problem.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very specific.
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when you use debit card than when you use your debit
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So that meeting is exactly how we <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that I would tell the staff to think about the positive things that they would come in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway in magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the <unk> <unk> display can contain from <unk> different kinds of different things to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Okay, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to us who are <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if only a little bit.
We need to increase incremental complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a good decision about buying a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that lets <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order that makes the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go out of a little choice, four <unk> a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you die, you always have a default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from many choices, <unk> the default button and again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options that are continuing there.
Same information, the same data is the same thing.
The only thing that I did was disrupt the order when the information comes together.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choosing the movement box doesn't tell you anything about the preferences of inner decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building is now more engaged with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> to get rid of alternate alternatives -- we can do it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented with were designed to help drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
It is that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about it.
And the more careful being in our choices will be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in the <unk> East Germany, if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
It had to record a sheet of example written with the machine.
And so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think someone could do this, so much that it would give us the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color laser in any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes them all of one and his printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be <unk> so much about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> on the line, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> and so on, and so on.
These guys are doing their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal media through banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a computer computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when he was frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us will be a victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most online crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, and celebrate protests, they motivate them about opinions, they motivating laughter.
<unk> like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> as Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the United States <unk> the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority <unk> authority or it was.
<unk> increases last fall due to a <unk>
<unk> the security of the site and <unk> a <unk>
I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government meeting asked one of the leaders of the Dutch leaders asked one of the leaders of people to be dying of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how does people die.
<unk> is an inclusive authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you serve the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> service services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign authority authority.
And they were leading to <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the protesters who were based on the <unk> law headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> <unk> they found a lot of papers.
Among those roles was this folder called <unk>
And within that portfolio there was notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government <unk> tools that had been sold to the Egyptian government <unk> the communication of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 500,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The headquarters for company is right here.
And so, the Western governments provide the tools to the government <unk> so that they do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officials to investigate its own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The connection to the Internet.
We can even build tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the online thinking, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why is it <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in game privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today, in 2011, any right to be <unk> today, will be forever.
Are we blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have been worried about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are cows of my dad, and the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have fences in the most part of the South, which means that wild animals like African-Americans migrate into the park.
And predators, like the lions are, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead in the morning and we found it dead because it was the only driver's had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and that's why we value it.
So I grew up with a lot of <unk>
They were dying of them that protect our community and livestock and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions was scared.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because I even helped male lions to see the pen away.
I don't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was close to <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions did not come from.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which he would turn on and turn the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
Let's get everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get out, because that's where they come from lions.
And this is how they see it when they come at night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago and since then, we never went back to having the lions.
And the neighborhood houses have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
The <unk> Can you see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by the entire Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also being used to get elephants away.
Thank you to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a fellowship at one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to go?
So a year ago, I was just a kid in all 2001 from the <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see flying airplanes and said it would someday be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come into airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer for aviation and pilot when they <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving my father and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Don't tell you how exciting you hear a story like yours.
So you've got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other <unk> electrical <unk>
What's the next on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one close electric <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know that <unk> <unk> but I want to make my own.
CA: So you would have done it once, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I just got a <unk>  CA: The foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> are something big.
We're going to get it into every step that I <unk> friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little boy, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is enemies.
Although I was sometimes wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed a sudden.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and myself had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And that said, "When we look at this, the five family members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A massive famine went to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million Koreans died during famine and just a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also made more and more frequent <unk> energy, all around me was completely close to dark at night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea on the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> at certain points, allowing Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river,
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugee would be.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a scary fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
And one day, my worst nightmare did actually, when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was invited in the police station.
And somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it wasn't natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another, "This was a fake card. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum.
But many of them may be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> had eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragedy that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can fit it in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to have a risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much larger challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different from 67 years of divide.
I even walked through an identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call my pride to me.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam for college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities were <unk> some money that sent to my family, and, as blame, my family was going to be moved to the force to a clear location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
I began to plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to engage in a way, for more than 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by an official from the Chinese officer.
He asked for all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family got liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I went and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asked, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary I explained to him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and to another two Koreans and take them out of prison.
I was <unk> with my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the people that are going to do when you get it more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting your freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language, English, jobs, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with familiar relatives inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Asia.
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food <unk>
And so the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center for the South State to represent something else, so they changed Los Angeles -- as if this <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> of <unk> food <unk> <unk>
Just like it took millions of other Americans, living in a food desert, Los Angeles South Indian Center, home for food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to get more people than food than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles, <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I emphasize that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold as cars.
I see <unk> <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
And then I got tired of driving for 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to get it.
This is how I decided to do it.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we got together and we started planting our forest of food, trees, <unk> you know, nine vegetables <unk>
What we do, we're a kind of a paid group by the way it made out of gardeners of all the <unk> from all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city got me on top of it, and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Go on, do it?
A court order to plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's do it."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I spoke to <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, go on, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It has 68 miles away from <unk>
That's 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant millions of tomato plants.
Why does it look like this?
<unk> a plant -- 10,000 seeds. seeds.
When a dollar <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
Put your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South Pole.
I grew up there. <unk> my kids there.
I was interested in being part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the earth, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine what amazing is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I am a witness to how my garden became a tool of education, the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how to affect the kids.
<unk> is the <unk> act and thought that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother, and she was like the <unk> at night and they were in my backyard, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like that.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame I was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces the why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they helped me download the truck.
It was great, and they shared his stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed it, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who come from, and they work and <unk> all of them on a volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, the kids eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, you eat <unk>  But if none of this is going to tell you, if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work with, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see the color of color that are on this path designed for them, which is not going to take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids to be aware of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all of a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy <unk>
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people together to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets, farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That the <unk> take their <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to meet me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come in your garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
strong. Thank you.
Thank you.
You probably all agree with <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made out of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go on your bicycle in your bicycle and these cars go that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, you'd want a <unk> road <unk>
The solution for that is to make streets of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, there are pores and the water can go through it, so that all the water water is going to flow down to the sides and you will have a road which is easy to drive, and it doesn't make water anymore.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at the road -- the rocks of the surface is <unk>
First, a stone, then several more and more and more, and then -- and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how damage damage to this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if you <unk> they're going to be bent and separated from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you will get the <unk> like we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use <unk> of steel, from that to clean up, and we can cut out the wool of steel in a very small chunks, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel knitting on it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel to melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried lots of samples out there and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we made a piece of road, 400 feet away from the highway <unk> where we had to make a lane test to prove this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel, bringing together these fibers using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, to actually increase the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before it can show you how the repairability does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what I was like, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban broke from Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we were going to take a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that it looks like we went shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every school was suddenly close for a week, because the Pakistani Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about them.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to go?
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the risk.
For him, there was a greater risk not to educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were times frustrated that I was very frustrated with our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. Can you let them leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So you still want not to do it.
I've got 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than high school, and if my family would have been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, and I am in the streets of Kabul.
My family thinks about me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the <unk> <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why they were <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I look at students in my school with a strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of an extraordinary opposition in front of it.
As a <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than one month ago, he and her daughter went on the road from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they're the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> now, if he <unk> he said, "but I don't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized in Afghanistan -- and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people -- there's a father who recognized the value of her daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of the brightest future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the from Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school to be told remember, remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I'm afraid that these changes didn't take a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and to their parents who were going to take away for them, I see the future <unk> and <unk> change.
And to me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
There are almost two years since the revolution broke out inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
One forces with many other citizens <unk> within and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> who were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, that were carrying billboards of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown an courage to face the brutal dictatorship <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a few losses from about 50,000 dead -- we were able to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
Yet <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved it, along with many other women, rebuild civil civil society, <unk> civil society and just towards democracy and national reconciliation toward democracy.
There are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the decline of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the Women's Women of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> orientation, <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and through our <unk> of participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved, and successfully.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
Yet a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution like a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> ancient <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The other day it would be <unk> with the news of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the police officer.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and his violations of violations of human rights with prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up of a revolutionary mentality -- it becomes more <unk> and it's away from the ideals of freedom, dignity, social justice, and we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of icons of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all today for our success story of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices don't brought the peace and stability to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by the selfish policies of domination and <unk> as well as men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the elections, which will only ignore polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the ultimate depiction of the female who will need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as a loss of outrage and calling days of anger.
We need to begin to act like agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also to put telecoms into respect instead of <unk> the collaboration instead of competence, inclusion in place to <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> in the war, needs desperately to get peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> that is known in all of the traditions that are <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> and <unk> that covers all the humanity that men and women, all the tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> which grows into the top of the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of it.
This is how "My mercy is telling all the things."
This is how to tell us, "My mercy prevalent about my <unk>
That all of them will be given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a embarrassing question, which has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to tackle is that everybody makes a great voice. Why is she left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who <unk> him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
He was 22 years old. He had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> me to head with a <unk> <unk> with an bullets of <unk>
The man who loved more than anybody in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> it with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I've been almost 20 years old, married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the races, all religions, all the world's levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> relationships and long duration or said otherwise in the families, the last place you would want or hope to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse, so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be left with a man who hits her, and I actually was a very typical victim for my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women of between 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, rainy night in January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City, and he started playing me with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had some big <unk> and <unk> and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it on the beginning of a <unk> <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything from me: I was ready to Harvard who had gone to Harvard and he would put my teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leaving my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I just quit my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> that was entering the head of a physical trap financial and very carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where those guns come in.
As soon as we move to New England you know, that place where they were supposed to be <unk> had to feel so much of a <unk>
He had one of the car <unk>
Another kept under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said they needed these guns to cause the trauma that lived in a small way.
I needed to feel sure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical heart attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend wetsuit from my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was confident that we lived happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> by the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and it never would hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so hard on the head that he <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey went on by traffic and threw a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> followed one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of marriage.
I was amazed at when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So I'll go back to my question: Why would I care?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man and it was the only person in the world that I could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just <unk>
Why didn't I get married, I could have gone at any time.
To me, this is the saddest and painful question of the people, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is killing her.
More than 70 percent of the murder in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim has finally gotten to the relationship, after the <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, <unk> of financial resources and manipulation of the family judicial system to help the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time to spend the man who <unk> their mother.
And we're still wondering why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> up to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told you all the world -- the police, my neighbors, my friends and friends and full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of the victims of the headlines -- <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a disturbing lesson from what happened and they would embrace their lives and joyful lives like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I became married with a guy and <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have ever more, ever -- is a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head in someone who says I want.
Right now, the same is thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, to his sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their friends, their friends and family.
It will define his vision of survivors as great people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to make consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims of a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the Siwa secure and <unk> who should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like that.  Luckily, I brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first set of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when some of the women were <unk> they don't have to go back and find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about about 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These neighborhoods are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to spend this sweater on the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend in real life.
And he was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was going to go back and put the hair back in the kid.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I made two days ago for work, there is very little we can do to transform our looks, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman, and in my labor sector, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how does it come to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage, that I've known to harness to earn money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much about models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- less than four percent, were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be model when you get older, you get.
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't do that.
But then, what I would really tell you about each of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be model, then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> of American American magazine or CEO of <unk> or next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, which, unlike surgical surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and you have a resume and a couple of jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, if you want to be president of the United States, but your <unk> Model Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look weird.
So the next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was looking at, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is how I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party.
Here I am with my soccer team in the <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many 20, from 20 inches and I never use, except the previous couple of the previous life, but the privilege I get is the I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to carry money, and I was given the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to continue <unk>
<unk> of these privilege -- for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the <unk> teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times I am <unk>
By researching this talk, I found out that by 53 percent of the <unk> of 13 percent of the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brighter hair, you'll feel very happy and wonderful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I think so.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people, clever and education.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask you, with some thinner legs and the brighter hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs of the brightest hair and your clothes, but it's probably the <unk> women of the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold from this talk, I hope that everybody is more comfortable with recognizing the power of the image in perception we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was most excited enough to put a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't go to my <unk>
There was no <unk> or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimal care in lighting.
In fact, most of them were getting random tourists randomly.
My story starts when I was looking at the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture holding my daughter on her first birthday. That's the corner of 57 percent and five.
I happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take me back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to make us <unk>
It's amazing that the gesture of calling the camera to a complete unknown to be so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are far more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week in October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceived and interact with everything.
That particular time we go together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the trips we were walking around, when suddenly he was stopped in the dry and pointed out of a red <unk> of the tent that <unk> in the previous visits before.
And he described me what I felt at five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> that I remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first nine and nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York City is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And then I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I wouldn't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always what it takes up the picture.
And I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't want to go closer to somebody and asked, does it take a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the world's <unk>
First, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, as characters <unk> stupid silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and the laughter, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't hold clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent disease radiation.
They're hardly <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face with a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> important, first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural <unk>
You know, the carcasses up to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria they help absorb their anthrax that will not be because they would spread and causing large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses are taken from three to four times longer in <unk> and this has huge branching into the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with the old culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of protective <unk> and <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and <unk>
In <unk> Hindu <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the Tasmanian goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> in places like <unk> there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> are provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are on extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities are using this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the endangered critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall out of the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there have been a spread on the number of dogs on the <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up with the <unk> lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrific trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so we can focus on a sustainable problem is not going to be done.
We have to work with governments at <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they <unk>
How can you help? It may become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you're going to tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with your children, with your neighbors about <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed from opinion because he saw it fly without effort, without energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and all I do <unk> my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- but I'm not.  I worked on Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a NGO NGO and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, which the Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything I did -- I think about it.
Our first project, which I was inspired by my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we came up with seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River and teach the local <unk> tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so what they would take care of them to come to work, and sometimes they were able to come to work, and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were amazed that the local, as fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not going to do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  <unk> at time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red, at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came out from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you give him your "You're never <unk>
I thought we just thought we were Italians -- errors in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they were doing -- what the <unk> did the <unk> and then see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to look at the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave them to <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
I try to deal with any different culture as if I were my children, "I want a lot."
I try to deal with all of the different culture as if I were <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The small is <unk> written by <unk> who said for about everything economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who's opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that won't be <unk>
I decided to make the 27-year-old only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you ever attract anybody, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why it wasn't, for once, but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance has a <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
People smarter from their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take your public meetings there.
What do we do? We work one to you, and we work face-to-face -- you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor and the family doctor of the business -- who sets up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do that? And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk> and I got back.   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor by philosophy before in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of death of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> they want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you for <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then you have to come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
So what can you talk about this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneur spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils are not renewable renewables, and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we interact with seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
You'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that I read in a magazine <unk> many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States were <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give them <unk>
Otherwise they don't come to talk with you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then later you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing -- you have to have a fantastic financial <unk>
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have looked at and look at the 100 hundred icons in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that every successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
Never do the word by it, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> next to their devoted <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for you, what someone asked you, what need to take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that <unk> that I read to <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much people pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our own needs and dream today.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with giant <unk> which give shadow <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
I always teamed up to the music.  There is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of U.S. properties.
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this led to me a profound gratitude for the time and life of time.
He gave him clarity to the significant things about my current life.
But let me just keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let it catch up and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> and painted about it phrases of <unk> Before he died.
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect about this experiment but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die of death, I want to be judged by <unk>  Before I die -- I want to sit on <unk> at the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die. I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I die of death, I want to push you back again.
Before I die. I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die of death, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space was kind of constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me solace in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and new ways that it's about to accommodate the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and we change it.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues of the civic center, we made a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to retain the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
<unk> is something we often avoid to talk about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that would be more power.
Think of the death of the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
Not speech, but it transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happens what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and notice about this: Never <unk>
When they sing songs of our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16. It's high. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I was sitting in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
Isn't that cool?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> in society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, if you wouldn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, and that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, is there no cause cure in the world.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new way to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child that I saw the world without <unk> a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, times when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, the communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change the normally.
<unk> is happening by high the beauty that give us differences and the fact that it's different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could show you one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift in its inner and, frankly, the pursuit of normality, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the moment that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a professor of communications, who would give a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their big words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> had had to have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt that I felt when I had those conversations with students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We need desperately a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to half and health care among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations can happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that they study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try to understand it.
And when you're describing their science, carefully with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> that is much more accessible to us?
<unk> is not the same thing to make them dumb <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein said, which everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
You can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is using examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of hooking up and <unk> with their content.
And when I present his job, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do?
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the language area of our brain and we will get it.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is a lot more effective, it shows that special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> Eiffel <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a bit, and then we will provide graphs that we replace our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is <unk>
I think these are only some key that you can help the other open to door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have fixed this equation, by all the media, go with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the <unk> of <unk> English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of <unk> in the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public and no matter whether he won, and when he won, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and he had a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that you could have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed run.
And there might be <unk>
All the world got tired of them, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read a daily <unk> newspaper.
Which caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of prison was against <unk>
The House of <unk> didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it as King if I was giving him or his <unk> ideas.
So, they wanted to give him the <unk> title plus and more unfortunate than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President's didn't invent the title. There was just before, but it only meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a <unk> title.
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take it seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't work.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never <unk> by the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government is <unk>  <unk> we might be going to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles are not equipped and so on.
The reality and the history of the <unk>
So eventually he won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness of time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now they're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I think that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually change it much more the words that what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters underground, in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but mostly that cacophony of <unk> male <unk> and rocks were born with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap lamp, of light -- <unk> holds the head with this little <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> that I had lost the control and fell down to the <unk>
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep at that hole at risking their lives without paying and reward and, often, dying.
I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they may never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the G8 <unk> <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which is devoted to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not such a grade.
When we finished talking to myself, I was really curious to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> <unk> and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the conductor of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
This is how my journey started to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even, I considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people are born in the world.
It's twice as much displaced African people during the entire slave side.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
So the equivalent of 50 dollars today.
However, today you can enslaving entire families for generations for increased 18 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery creates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false promises of good education, better work to find out that they are obliged to work without pay, low violence and they can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those those produce these are disposable things.
<unk> exists in almost everybody -- and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees Celsius -- men, women, kids, in fact, of fact, all the whole families put together in a heavy <unk> <unk> stacked <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 to 17 hours a day.
There was no Google to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> made it pee on it quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly that I'll demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were already gone.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system because of his release and he trusted that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
And in the Himalayas, I found kids carrying rocks for miles through <unk> land to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids to charge them, and the kids would <unk> them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been that whole life.
You don't have anything to <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they had entirely their homes.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, I was advised that it would be hard for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
He took me through a few stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as it's known in the craft, they are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms -- where they were <unk> them with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- they're forced to entertain clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer abuse their hands of their clients.
From foot in <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what is going to be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where you were going.
There was no <unk>
There was no big ones like <unk>
Those people don't have any <unk> and because you touch a really difficult topic, it is important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor with labor labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were whole families in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of it.
<unk> hands are the father, the <unk> blue and red, of red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, will be able to leave this house someday and go to another place where we're really paid our job."
It is estimated that there are over 4,000 children -- <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I was going to look very quickly.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger children -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families out and forced to work successfully in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by fear of falling into water.
<unk> branches in the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and kids, <unk> and fear, you get to the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like the whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to be the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were getting the last networks, but they had been working from the one one.
On the cold night and <unk>
And I would point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will be because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a <unk> who had his motorcycle suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
We were asked to get it through a dirt path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to go out of the car, and asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed up this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we began to go down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the road and after walking around an hour found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as they were <unk> in these waters, to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up at one of the course of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field and all of them were full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children bound to their backs and while they were looking at gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners in a pit on another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pit they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes <unk> <unk> because many had been under Earth for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people have to carry heavy heavy stone bags that then will be <unk> to another area where they <unk> the stone to be able to extract the gold.
To the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to it, and you can see it to work at least less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of T.B. and the <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When his uncle, his uncle, was <unk> the debt of the uncle that force it to being slave in mines.
When I met her, I'd worked in the <unk> and the leg lesion that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, to that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has to be liberated and <unk> with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, face to a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to drop light on slavery.
They knew that your images would be seen by you all around the world.
I wanted to know that we will have testimony to them and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines. These are real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think of these so many people so beautiful -- I think I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in the people you can see in people like you, and I hope that force turns to a fire and that <unk> <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we are, we are like management revolution.
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were looking at the <unk> of ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later.
But the demands for a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease -- destroy this extraordinary ability, how does it with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a virtuous ballet ballet ballet crew.
Over the last few years has been transformed into treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress of progress in objective and ultimately, the only way we can know if there's really a cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement are not <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could get the test <unk>
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to think about as a conventional way to try to do a try, you see, in a sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vocal cords <unk>
It shows someone right as it emits sounds to speak, and we can imagine, as dancers of a vocal voice, because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed -- <unk> for example.
And like <unk> requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as it <unk> and as the Parkinson's affect your limbs, also affect the <unk> organs.
In the plot of the bottom you can see an example of a irregular <unk> example of the <unk> strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests on the voice with the clinical clinical trials that are both <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both of them are precise -- well, but also standardized tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are full and we all know what happens.
When something takes a lot of <unk> cost to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the long-term difficulties of patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk>
With high monitoring we could get objective data.
We could make a massive <unk> for clinical clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by doing the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's <unk> Initiative,
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines in accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call under a price and leave recordings of a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the heart disease. Sure.
<unk> You can see, some people may not know. You may not hear it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion looking for the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> precision at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we did the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in rooms without windows and, usually, we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin we do the impossible to do the impossible, and we would get into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of time, but some of us really really love the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the events that happened in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> There was <unk> in the place working as part of the response team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 to <unk>
It's a small indigenous people in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave, one of the first people.
The water level reached over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers into the inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools took the mud and we left the ready houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We loved us, and we loved it.
And for weeks, so much volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around the world to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
Whereas the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
By the end of my first week, I started to help in a center of <unk>
It helped clean up the <unk> gigantic toilets, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> pick the photos.
And so I had them and I had the honor that that day would come in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I moved back to myself my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl -- I had to have a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl wouldn't look like it would look like her, and that would be so tragic as I had the photo <unk>
With the time of time, they became very much more pictures and they needed more <unk> so I walked back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
By the end of two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village to northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in libraries that were temporal temporal libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could involve an hour. I could make a weeks.
I could do a few months.
This <unk> had to draw in virtually hand using a guide to the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures appeared in salt water covered with algae with algae, and even oil -- all of that with the time I continue <unk> so he was a part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the picture unless it was clean and dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have the guide to a <unk>
It's very easy to harm the pictures that are already <unk>
As he once said, <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same one, but he stopped to realize that it was even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> the images in a single photo and put it on the whole picture.
When I collected his pictures shared some of his story shared with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photos in a field station between the rubble of a pretty far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their little children -- not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her pictures his son lower 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could go back and look, something that I could remember from the past that he hadn't been tagged on the last day when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined over there, <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority -- the great majority -- the vast majority come to their hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families and hundreds of <unk> and <unk>
For this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures of them.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would get to you but the first thing that we want to look for.
What about this was the project, of restore small pieces of humanity, to bring somebody out of their connection to the past.
When a picture like this gets to somebody, it's an enormous difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger -- going back something, using your talent to something that are not thin skin models, perfect skin.
I would like to read this email. And I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was born, I couldn't stop thinking about the people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women from different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, little girl -- <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter <unk>
In the whole world, in all the very few our basic needs -- right?
Thank you.  <unk>
Doc <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that crosses an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a <unk>
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in a slow motion of light light.
And so we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they really challenge the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on and <unk> in a <unk> of a second or so, in various <unk> to create a <unk> photons just a millimeter package.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this pack of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons get inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of the light on the <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola didn't take a <unk> this research --  -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a little package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light <unk> goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that bounce inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel over the table, and because of the ideas of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the insights would be <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and make it go through the same distance and you see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us sitting to see that film?
One day? In reality, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie -- a bullet in motion.
And what about testing it is <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way that nature sees a picture, thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> OK?
But if you look at this little bit more of this tomato -- you'll notice that, as the light gets rid of it, it's still bright. They don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the <unk> light inside and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is on your phone -- you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So why do we create this camera at <unk>
As photographers, you know, if you take a photo to <unk> it gets very little light.
But we will go to a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition -- so I can barely get some light.
<unk> that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> and we took those <unk> of data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all these raw data and make it interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can.
And if a new power of a future can allow you to look at the <unk>
The idea is that we could drop some light on the door, you go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point corresponds to what distance.
By projecting a laser you can record a photo in <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we will take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, we are going to come up and try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction of behavior.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that will happen.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or could we build <unk> you can see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization of visualization to solve the problems of delivering in health care.
Just like Doc <unk> himself a scientist, it became science in art, an art of photographs of it.
I realized that all the data <unk> of data that we collect are not only for scientific visualization, but we can be able to be able to do it.
So creating a new form of computer photography with slow motion and colors, <unk>
And look at those waves remember, the time between each of those waves is from just about a <unk>
But here's something that is fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, I would have loved to see this image.
The order where the events occur in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
Let's take the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A cell can change your life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, you would go and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people <unk> that <unk> for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who to show you guys have a phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot, almost everybody has a cell phone.
But today I'm talking about my phone today, and how I really changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every single Internet provider has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends him a text to who.
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years to their phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people that were coming out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret policeman of Eastern Germany.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> who at the time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to make a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we're not going to give this information.
At the end, he agreed.
They demand demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court ruled by the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 information lines.
At first I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open von <unk> we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go back and go forward.
You can see every step I make.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this great communication network.
You can see how people communicate each other, what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who sends an email to whom, as you can have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone mobile.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe it never happened.
And as a result, not the decline of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to do it forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, you get to your representative that only because businesses and state agencies can store some information, don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind them that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I would take my mom six times in six different different different different different different <unk>
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, brothers, though they are.
It's just going through accidents, as I came up at birth.
Now, I'm not a source of inspiration. I don't want any of you in the room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go on a walk.
Christmas Christmas are in the center center, they drive in a search for parking lot and what you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I say, I have 99 problems, and you know, the C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am <unk> Muslim and woman, and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I am from Park.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the ear.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system, my parents would come to the school system, and they would laugh that I also were, and if I didn't get all the ultimate note -- all the <unk> my mother.
My father taught me how to walk the five years by putting my bags on her feet and just walking.
Another approach I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me so that I was doing it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was so hard and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arab and still being all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians thought appropriate to use <unk> like <unk>
The people I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
But it seemed to be <unk> a lot of that died of hunger during the <unk>
And I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so you check the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wouldn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we wouldn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were focusing on <unk>
On the summer vacation I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk of <unk> so I was drinking milk <unk> on the back, and I remember the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and thought, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's pretty boring, but before you do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> that I could not stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in the head.
My parents would come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a fellowship for the State University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater department.
I all hate me.
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classes, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in <unk>
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> <unk> I will have a <unk>
I've got <unk>
At the end of the end of it <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, screaming historically, as if someone had killed my cat, asking him why and she told me that I could not make the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role to which literally had been born and gave a actress without cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
And I went back home, and my first <unk> <unk> was kind of extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was evident to me that the directors of <unk> not <unk> actors, and <unk> with disabilities.
Just to lie to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour tour, I took famous comics from New York City to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comical that he took when he was at the top of the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all over the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you've never heard that very small rumor that says that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother's brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York Festival <unk> in New York, now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and sometimes remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight to the challenge of stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news news program by wire, and Keith <unk>
I went to a graduate dance and I went to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held off to the desk of the man who was not going to leave the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
In order I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just as <unk> <unk> and pasted my chair.
A funny thing that I learned in straight with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that children are <unk> but they would never get away from me and no longer even more.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk> <unk>
I saw clips online with comments like, "Why do you work?"
"It's <unk>
And my favorite one, <unk> <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested I even would say my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't do somebody on a wheelchair.
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors say they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, I don't think that <unk>
I hope that we could create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My tortuous journey has led me to a very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give the young refugee children, a tiniest part of what my parents told me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting live, and I do this talk to her memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I would like to tell you a story about a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know their story.
He lives in a small village in the South Side of <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there's no job, no focus on the future.
He just lived in a tent on the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you get to a man who offers him to <unk> then for dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
I present a young boy.
Finally I go.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That boy from that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected organization to al Qaeda.
So how the story of a small town of a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that was arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story repeats in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to violence, to <unk> will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent doesn't work, it's not going to school.
They don't quite do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had forced me to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few juvenile leaders at a business end.
They took about 90 percent juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because I was a graduate student, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect <unk> for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to reach B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> ship to local residents who normally couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think that your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
They were going to tell young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for as well.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of the business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If you tell somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those of you who grew up in civil war, the answer is <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for drugs, creating gardens in the houses, and now it's working in the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young families, they can go together, and, as he says, smells <unk> <unk>
By the way, he doesn't cultivate <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance and guidance to them in the development of their businesses.
<unk> to young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not simply selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
Her Park, this is how they call it when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children from the street to help rent and keep their bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to make young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and feeding innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains <unk> a <unk> area in upstate New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun was making the <unk> leaves like a <unk> and it will not be on the path that we were <unk> we almost can pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed on a <unk> with a beautiful opaque lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet, with apple hearts -- <unk> <unk> paper balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and he would get a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you get the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who cleaned our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, at the bottom of <unk> tons of waste and 2,000 tons of food products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What is it like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I started working like <unk> <unk>
Now I don't just travel in our trucks. I would not just travel in <unk>
And they <unk> the mechanical and bar <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong one of them <unk>
It costs a lot used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept beating the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of State, <unk> the waste of waste is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're walking out and entering traffic all day and <unk> around you.
They just want to be <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the <unk> of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be in motion.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective form every day, this starts to get rid of their containers and their dangers inherent engage us in very real forms.
And so we had been controlled by decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the engines of economics begin to fail when it's at the danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out your relationship.
And then there is what I call our everyday speed speed required.
And I mean by simply the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't <unk> or <unk> <unk> or we took our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that will move from it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep us safely from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste garbage truck on the street, I grabbed my son and I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and I had a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank for her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
Shortly after that I began to investigate the waste of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together and we made good friends.
I want to believe it was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and having to realize all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste, what we think when we talk about garbage is three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see someone whose job is to clean the trash from you, take a moment to help you.
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall center in several stories in the capital of Addis Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed us as example, to my team and me about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
So after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the coating with crystals generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees over the year.
And thirdly, it has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to the open air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to inspect the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, not yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating on an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the inputs on the building.
And this goes into a <unk> atrium, that creates a space to open air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would call the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a wall shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on dresses in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these small colors of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center, it was not what it was.
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center, because in the end of the service there was more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it no longer needed to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and the bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which is collected from water to the indoor tower.
It's wait for the beginning of the next year, because we're going through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I got very carefully attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure, which was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access connected by lower straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was expand the existing streets, creating 12 <unk> building blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick up some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the interconnected doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the <unk> as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we put a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It's got these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up greater density at higher levels and lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like <unk> the community occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can upload it and make such activities such as a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives, of people changes the communities and the local economies at the same rate that are growing buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but we need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have a goal to connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had large amounts of hair and very bright hair and a small <unk> of crayons that was very strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the <unk> of school, I was a little late afternoon, and I was <unk> in the <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's teacher.
And then I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few <unk>
All the <unk>  And I set up to bring back the book into <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I went to all rows of <unk> and I just put myself a row and just by being there, because I would get there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell me.
It's that everything was <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I would tell myself the reason why I was bothered by this little little bit of good for <unk>
I loved jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause of <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that observe loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab where you study them in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> <unk>
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There's no Shakespeare.
I took away the high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as it was almost the ones that have all of them.
This year has been 100 years of his masterpiece, "In it for the time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.  And and thinking about <unk> we have the <unk> right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forgot about how it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as he <unk>
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go as well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the assumptions that are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a good storytelling base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
So now as storytellers and audience, we know exactly what kind of details we want to do to <unk> the knife <unk> right?
<unk> make us all amateur novelists and that is something I was trying to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds it to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
<unk> were <unk>
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links fine language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of course, you hear behind the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then they <unk> those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, for finding the truth, really a really painful thing -- in fact, to be able to be <unk> the more painful the truth of it.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a range of feelings far deeper and vital than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> tell us to ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open up in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at so much <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
A day, Freud been visited by a young man who was being used with the idea that his wife would be.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man who didn't get <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing that <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or do accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> are made to look in intensity but no precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are, more we become fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to make violent acts or illegal acts.
<unk> are driving us to behave completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about my case at eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which he would send out horrible messages to itself, for one year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> her new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with admiration at all?
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to look at our minds, and once we are on the sphere, in the kingdom of the <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to be <unk> and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- <unk> your name, brings your <unk> <unk> your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, so much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> the head <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of these mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the six <unk> once you go in there, <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> I wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> moved in the story. It looks like this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated as a problem with no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> there is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are the same side.
Suddenly, it allows you to admire that idea of being he <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can stick with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just fiction that jealousy.
fiction used to <unk> invites me to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the crazy <unk> Black <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July from 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> <unk> module and landed on the Caspian Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were <unk> but their presence on the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
And the Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To reach the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo brought work to about 400,000 people and asked <unk> collaboration companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, which I <unk> after Armstrong death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you care?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that he was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why would it turn our goal?
And they could also ask, why is the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly over the <unk>
Why is it playing Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West about the east in the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was the wonder of wonder when the powers of technology.
It was because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological <unk>
The first half of the 20th century, produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and they took smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew 10 flew to 40,000 miles, / hour.
From 1970, any human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful joyful about the power of technology has evaporated over to see that the problems that we imagine that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure the cancer, or to feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he doesn't go to the <unk> tube of the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission -- but I was completely sure I was going to be seeing colonies on Mars.
So what that happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear that all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have met us, and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed up sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't accept the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation for us in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious than <unk> from the years that they were <unk> <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, and specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the creation of risk led to creation of innovative ideas by funding or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investments of which they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had a problem to invest with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and where development is in the long term. They don't have invested in the development of technologies intended to solve large problems because they don't have an immediate value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would take a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative sources of energy that can compete at prices don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in today's political climate that we're going to see an energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the food route, by food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and food <unk> but there will be famines as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon declared war into the 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years seemed to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but we have to have four elements of <unk> the political leaders, and the population must want to want to be able to solve the problem: the institutions have to support the <unk> must be really about an <unk> problem and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a model model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and the dangerous, and there's no science science mythology -- like about exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be straightforward.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have a problem with no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about the trust, and I'm going to start with you with the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, is a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, and I think it gives you a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think it's <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me turn to think that it may have dropped from some or institutions or institutions that might have increased in others.
I don't have sure.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at polls in the long time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same distrust.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway away.
But this is enough?
What opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
I probably wanted to ask, "What do I what?"
And that would be a very fair answer.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust them in some, but elsewhere.
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit confidence.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> officer or <unk> is going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I trust that I trust an elementary teacher that I know to give the class, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to address the good judgment to be inherent in terms of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's stupid.
It's not that goal that I <unk>
I want to have more confidence in what's <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who <unk> their savings with the very rightly called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it says, yes, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to make a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> at <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are pretty sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would get your own <unk>
And I'm very glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to do to do before we trust.
And trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to judge.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build accountability of accounts for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, let's tell you the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that will take her mind in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we will argue that the accountability system that is destined to ensure that it is going to ensure that it is going to ensure that it is the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You've got to all of you know a similar examples.
And we had all that, by the goal.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are worthy of trust and <unk> to people who are reliable and whether to determine whether other people, officials are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations of enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> usually all the people all the time.
But you also have to give them evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do we do that?
That's a daily basis, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
And the store I buy my socks on my socks and say I can put them together without giving you <unk>
I carry them up and get your money back, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great -- I trust them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that it is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have any <unk>
I started to imagine how it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that was <unk> in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen, its physical body to the ground.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool you break down.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill <unk>
In the design of Science <unk> with Microsoft, along with my mentor mentor -- <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
We put a transparent bombsight with the cameras in deep to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, go into the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as you can grab a book from a <unk>
You can go through the book, and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is below every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
We had a lot of us have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make physical physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this one <unk> physicist.
This magnet, <unk> it acts like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of metabolic levitation and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And to programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and will be replicated and stay in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and a distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan you can play it as a physical reality sometimes you want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike monitors or textbooks, and that's a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's most fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not only going to show us something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to <unk> ourselves from our world.
So we started the talk today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years of <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed strongly that there was only a path to <unk> a safe and safe job.
No matter whether I work or not.
But my dream was to be an singer from Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But any adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew that it was too much longer to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class was the only thing you could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking for another <unk>
No one to me, I wanted to <unk> OK.
<unk> to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
Those who were wrapped in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but it's strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told you, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my TV habit <unk>
So let's take a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me -- because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China did not have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields as political and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the nonprofit reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
Can you be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> of David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By Christ, the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of losing in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feel like or powerless never.
Having a dream is <unk> it's really not compared to what many other people have had.
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of sleep.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, where the dreams, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, I am here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> and he jumped on the couch in my office took off the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought the sessions, it made me easy to move your head while they were going to get the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work after that, it's home, and then you have kids later, even the death goes next.
By <unk> like Alex and I had time to <unk>
But shortly after, my squad pushed me to press Alex who was talking about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under the <unk> <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> he said, "No no, but maybe it would be <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were doing, but this didn't do that by Alex <unk> they were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of Mayan <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life -- but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a dream a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to the 35 years.
That means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments of <unk> that give life to life that will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People of more than 40, not panic to panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that over half of the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
The <unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common impact has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the line of time of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> names <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that for great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing absolutely happens.
And then every day, poor intelligent, interesting things like you or your kids and daughters come up to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm not killing your time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be OK."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better relate the day that I graduated from college."
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running around and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, the music went off."
I didn't want to be the only one who stopped standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it doesn't look at the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of you start a career, choose a city, choose a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red car cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career that you want now.
You see, you can't have the son that you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about her <unk> "What was I like, "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said I'd like to work in art or entertainment or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult, very difficult life that had been even more difficult.
They are often <unk> in our sessions, but then it gets up her same to say, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost all the time.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his lots of contacts, but then he stayed looking at the empty space that follows after the words of <unk> please call me <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit with Alex as to just sit while the 1950s.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told him to be aware of that crisis of identity and <unk> capital capital.
From identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: your identity capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> the exploration exploration -- I'm setting the exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma <unk> and I would tell him to tell.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent to take you at the airport, but the ones who come together with friends with similar minds are just limited to who you know what they know about, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person with whom are almost always coming from the nearest circle there.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half isn't -- and the weak links are the way we put this group.
The half of the work that we created was never <unk> so knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information goes on.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma will soon go to his family, when he has a partner and it exists his own family.
I said to Emma the time to choose his family had come.
You may think that 30 is better at the age of getting better than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now or you will tell you now when everyone on Facebook begin to walk into the <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that implies to be so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or kill time with anyone who <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped get a job there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave her boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special about events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
He had her new career, she loves her new family, and I sent myself a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts, are not enough <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like airplanes that come out of the airport from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea that was worth spreading all the <unk> who have heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to do Alex.
This is what I have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma all <unk> <unk> aren't the new <unk> <unk> <unk> get their <unk> get their <unk> get their weak ties.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in consultancy <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to seventh grade in New York City in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I did tasks.
When the work went back, they get grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance had no scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in seventh grade in seventh grade -- secure, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was so convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they were working hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
But what happens if you succeed in school and in life depends much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of astronomical environments, and in every study my question was, who has successful success here and why?
My research team and I went to the National Academy team.
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in neighborhoods really difficult, what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of the learning results.
We partnered with private companies, asking yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their job work?
and who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, they emerged a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly higher chance of motorcycle even when they were able to measure, in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the tests, even the safety they felt the children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or <unk> National <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for kids at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, the science of how much of the science knows about.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a great job work <unk>
How do I keep it for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going on with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, common determination is not related or even related to Creative measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing people's determination is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not a touch that can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all of them again, with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
And since that moment, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can pull down this <unk> so that whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy to understand.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of traffic, menus of restaurants, to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it is <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were screaming <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of medicine, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call the radical eight characters.
These are building blocks so that they create many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are <unk> three are <unk>
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's an endless cycle of <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a tree is just a <unk> tree.
Do you remember the <unk>
Two fireworks together, it's very hot.
Three peaks together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Get a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played a little home?
This person is coming up on a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three of them together, they're <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight radical will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each little effort, they will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing as you learn a Chinese of eight years.
So after knowing the <unk> we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun put in the beginning, because Japan is in the east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the novelty has become out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw <unk> <unk>
The movie mastered his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and carry a magic bullet.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of an industrial complex program of child fantasy show.
However, the Oz magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise to the last 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a kid <unk> <unk> to a girl on the <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the <unk> magician and all the movies we see today.
One is that there are very little violence on the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the Oz magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
You use the magical shoes to defeat the arms produced by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Oz magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did <unk> <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son as well.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  so she was so slid in the room, and he was very impressed like a mom -- he had his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what he was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be things of value <unk> perseverance and <unk>
I would have the feeling that Luke had an army to overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> <unk>
How do you make Dorothy the movie?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to them, and not a world of men who <unk> that is where we are.
Why is it so much force capital in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of women's violence films on the girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
Now, I know the experience that the princess <unk> it doesn't give me the right framework that I would have served to navigate around the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really hoped that the credits start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and defend the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, the kids, they're not really their target public.
They make a phenomenal job of teaching girls how they defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being <unk>
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to come up in classical after classic every one of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and a man and the two men who raised a little girl.
So, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let me stop them.
Well, almost none of these movies is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not yet the roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to begin a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the <unk> in the 1980s, a conversation that had had a friend about the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the movie, there are more than a female character that has <unk>
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the guy that you like to like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus about what a movie <unk> movie <unk>
<unk> doesn't happen to be <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 <unk> movies how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women said it's been sexually sexually in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for kids have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that <unk> one of the things I think is that there's a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do is <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, then to charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're putting that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to be asking, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of connection is changing radically.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that you care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite cartoon character, <unk> Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to protect their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I will tell my <unk> Go and struggle and struggle and more stories where their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people to better and better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I liked was to look for fortune cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would make me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to look at them.
Yet over time, I was going to get back to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I do with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of 10 miles of length next to the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what I took to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place that's located in the eastern Delta, of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process using fake color, suddenly the place looks as a brilliant pink place.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes in the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place stands in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Roman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge economy of <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> miles per miles.
They run the <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape?
And I'll try to find out that the random is the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs, you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we're looking for layers of human conditions.
Five feet down, under a thick <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> layer of several hundred years that comes back from the Roman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found jobs from <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Roman Empire these are the rocks that <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite shop shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but we would go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do the ideas really started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a lost city, not for much time and found from above.
It certainly puts the search for seashells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk>
And I would like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
So now we had a group of <unk> obese in bicycles.
They're competing at a <unk> race and go in the direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that go on its side, rays of the wheels that end up in places, <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
And just the lobby, or what there is on the next side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse on a horse on it.
It's a horse that speaks to.
Can you feel your blue <unk> tickle your nose.
You can smell the cookie <unk> and you can go into the mouth.
They slept on one side and enter his living room.
In the room, and doing most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing over his center, singing <unk> <unk> <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> and from the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len in "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a wise <unk> of wisdom.
There were several men and a few ladies from different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just look at them once.
We were looking at the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
It creates entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be made of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
And I said, <unk> when you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using these old techniques invented by two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval <unk> used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, "What is I heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of the competition, and <unk> who's a wonderful and bright English -- although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember having a problem with <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, a lot of treaties on writing about writing is about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having <unk> memory and grown wasn't such a rare thing as it might like this today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we have changed.
They have changed us, and I would argue that they have changed cognitively cognitively too.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes we have to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate people about this idea of a <unk> memory -- <unk> and grown is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a bunch of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know how to be able to be able in some form of structural or structural or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them into an MRI scanner, <unk> their brains while they were looking at numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that on the memory champions they found out that on the memory champions <unk> different to others.
In fact, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driving as an armed race where each year shows someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors must take a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits long, <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox of <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their work is <unk>
The same word, different ability to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance in their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back a half thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because first, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up by foot, <unk> his love poem, and it was <unk> and as soon it was, the classroom.
They went to everyone.
But not only killed all of them, but shattered the bodies <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they wouldn't be able to get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I was standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed my eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where he was sitting there.
I took the relatives <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or a word word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you tell me that I would tell you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who I was sitting on the horse just brown in your lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with things that you want to remember -- the more crazy -- and the more crazy thing, it will be the image -- it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treated of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it in memory the same way that I would have done it -- if you were invited to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy crazy image to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remember that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote is that you want to tell.
And then it comes back in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they will talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not word by word, which is going to confuse you but typical per capita.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in its memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event <unk>
Seriously, is like looking at a lot of people sitting at Caltech -- I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets rid of the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there's incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all of the <unk> before you sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was fun.
I would never have expected to go to.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What it is actually about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> I mean by <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard standard training training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of the safety glasses with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
I ended up coming back to the very competition that had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could put it in a kind of an experiment called <unk> <unk>
I thought this could serve as good as it was for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are so just tricks.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to get them to build <unk> or <unk> <unk> to gain with a little bit of insights about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it would be a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
And when we really focused deeply on.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even shortcuts.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> kind of a deep processing species, a kind of complete attention that most of them are not lying around.
But the reality is, there's no shortcuts.
That's how things become <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what I <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our little existence is going to be <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who who walks around our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even dare to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that you remember remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so we would get it just a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, me I was six and lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And then you all have been watching television watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, I all looked at me and I went back and I would come back in a towel and I would come back in a towel and I would come back in a towel and I would come back in a towel and I would come back in a
And I was like this.
It was unable to go and hated it.
And I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and from the <unk> of the area, but of those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we want.
And it's no wonder we feel like that because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about it, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about being built in a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways that we built our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, solid in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public <unk> which was done in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it's got a <unk> it's got this round thing, columns, red brick -- that they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use communication in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, reading and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects who are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life.
We wanted to sort of <unk> and <unk> so we get out of the people.
And all of the black <unk> you think we feel good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and go back to these symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we are all happy, and so we started experimenting with <unk> we get to swing the pendulum behind the back and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
We will give the pendulum <unk> in the other direction.
We take those shapes we know that like and <unk>
And we added neon and we added cake. and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and turn them into <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating other memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and begin to swing the address again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with what's called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques in the computer, and we find new <unk> a few shapes that are <unk> against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, he opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical scholars were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao increased at a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect.
But how is it possible that these forms of wild and <unk> how it is possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And then it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We created an emotional reaction to these forms.
The same thing did the main mayors of the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium country with other architects <unk>
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few architects of elite <unk> at the threshold of the new millennium, started to go with all of the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
You think, for example, how you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation of <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all of architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location there.
The architecture is everywhere, so that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before we know if I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to come back to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel and steel or the lift, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the Internet applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, all the way to be on both extremes in <unk> and actually becomes the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
We can now do almost <unk> symbols with emotional charge, something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works, in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked at exactly the product done, no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get and shared in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a medium of communication, because these are not just images from a building, it's the images that you did from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of your personal narrative -- and that makes us <unk> with collective memory. And when we load these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but that has changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to look for <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people from <unk> and telling them that there's no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Now, architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it through the architecture.
That means that the pendulum pendulum <unk> from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find proper solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, of architecture, and it means that buildings tomorrow will be very different than today's buildings.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique, and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas that must be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will join the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to do sports or to <unk> or even one can marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream swimming in the East Side of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community united around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We have been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them to the <unk> spaces of local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does this great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast to their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do is look in the mirror.
She really loves her reflex.
It's laughing and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And it made me think, when stopped doing this?
How do we suddenly do that with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are seeking to Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, you only want to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a bit confused because, although his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Between what his mom says and what his friends, or colleagues in the school say, you don't know who we believe.
So a video of her, he puts it on YouTube, and he asks others please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve thinking about them.
We talked about a healthy and regular <unk> who gets these answers into one of the stages of their most vulnerable life stages.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is bringing them to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We have never been so connected, so we have been so connected, so <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected to our kids to behave based on the number of people who have and the kinds of feedback that they get.
There's no divide between a living and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is <unk>
What is the highlight of the life of someone in front of them in a every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover from the news from the <unk>
<unk> zero is still dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young men are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of superheroes in sports and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other ways start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they don't look good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as we get to the society of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One in five aren't <unk> at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you look good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're fine enough, you get a note lower to the average of your companions who don't care about that as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it turns out regardless of what these young young people.
So, in order to get right, we are talking about how you see you, not how you're really.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with time they make less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they're involved in more diet not healthy that they can lead to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this because of what makes decisions more <unk> like alcohol and alcohol and drugs, diets <unk> aesthetic <unk> sexual relationships and without protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing to the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're <unk> again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women don't present to an interview interview on a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is about interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we have to nurture trust in its own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, I would have the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only going to have an positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are really crucial to anyone willing to provide a education in body self-esteem and work.
A education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
And I really challenging the status of the current status of the women and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you about the contribution of our <unk> <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people why they are, not as you can see.
All of us can begin to do that by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments we published in our social networks.
We can advise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to be valuing their whole person, valuing their individuality, diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
It is going to make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out on the big screen, because just let's create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to be seen from being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have to mind?
Their <unk>
Their <unk>
Their <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
Could it just be the woman who is at two car seats over a distance. What would it mean for her if he released out of that voice <unk> in his interior, which was <unk> for you not to have a long legs, <unk> more <unk> feet plus <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this would be able to unlock his potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images are holding us all together.
But let's start our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They brought the self-esteem into the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And to work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, are becoming agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense of Defense <unk>
As soon as I was initially informed that innocent but being a prisoner of other charges in the company of others, they started planning to plan attacks at about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
And luckily, those plans would be held by an <unk> of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center could not help them.
He later <unk> he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who had an American engineer with an American mother, <unk> school <unk> among the two made a happy childhood, <unk>
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most of the Muslims, get to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take a interact, it doesn't take a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of the human group, there are always a small fraction of people who are so supportive of people who think we need to use all the possible means for everybody living as them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to <unk> training in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk>
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to point to the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little light light on the goal and to surprise all of all, especially mine, all of the target broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, maybe a child.
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, I understood what they found so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of them being condemned by putting a van going with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground park of the World Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I call them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody was time to pack up and go to another town.
As I was always my face of the classroom often was a <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the <unk> quiet and <unk> was enough.
So most of the time I spent on house reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not developed social skills, to say, <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> <unk> judge people judge people, based on things like your race or your religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they had to test my thinking about was the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence, as I had been <unk> <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who we had made friendship, was Jewish age.
I took a number of days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that my entire life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work, in Bush -- an amusement park park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I wish we wish to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that was being homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart made me become <unk> honest about my <unk> and help me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a time when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how my way I was changing my thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes <unk> of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone else is going to try to bring violence, can I hear my story and understand that there is a better path. That even though I was invited to this ideology of violent and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
At the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victim of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For terrorism victims, to speak against those acts of <unk> as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put me here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this moment there is a movie that projects in their minds.
This is an incredible <unk> movie.
It's 3D and it's got <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film is <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like a time of your childhood that project yourself in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experiences everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, tea, you and you.
There's nothing to know more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I don't know that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we were not conscious -- nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these movies <unk>
Why are we not only the robots that we have to do to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is an objective to be objective now.
<unk> for nature, is <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because during almost the entire century, we would get that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior in neuroscience -- the neuroscience of the brain was not, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a blooming of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to <unk>
There is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, not tackles the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a movie internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do we operate <unk> how they work, how they work, how they're <unk> and <unk> are all questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that all of the behavior is accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that it works for a long time, beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But in the end, I came to the conclusion that that wasn't working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get it at this point.
We have a whole chain of wonderful explanations -- so we get used to this; the physics explains chemical chemistry, explains biology, biology, explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think the consciousness, I think it's sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision around the world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need to have ideas that initially <unk> crazy before being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective movie movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions, functions of the brain behaviors and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> awareness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denied that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time you left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
We have fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they look principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the key <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- time, mass, mass laws. So I applied the basic laws of <unk> and postulated the electrical load as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- spatial ideas, time, mass, mass, then a matter of logic, you have to <unk>
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other basic concepts -- space time, the mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can do in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> -- every single system is conscious, not just humans -- dogs mice, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of empathic distress when you think always traveling at the speed of light.
I never can slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But the thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude <unk> to make some primitive precursor in consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so crazy?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, as the others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we think about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing -- there's a consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information that called <unk> which measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And that <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an amazing degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an average degree of integration of information, just as significant degree of conscious awareness.
But when it comes to worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In the theory of <unk> there will still be a different awareness of a zero awareness.
In fact, a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It will take the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies below.
As Stephen Hawking, like, where does the fire begin?
From the <unk> vision the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists can basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this view, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not being outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This is vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some may be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything to have consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you will get much hungry.
I think we think about it, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural asking for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing.
If this is right now, they are involved in serious ethical problems, pretty serious about the development of computer computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the collective collective people, the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a local level, a group integrated -- as the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have a collective collective consciousness, an inner film for this whole group of TED <unk> different from the inner movies from each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, as how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally be going to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just use the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, one under education.
I went to school, I joined my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, I was a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a wrong problem.
She's not really gotten out of anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What's a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't make anything extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school -- just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 minutes, a guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What's <unk>
Well, I had been talking to you about law enforcement for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about things in school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this boy had experiences with people with disability as <unk>
And we don't are. And it's not the blame for the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people, we're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital range.
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and doesn't make make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the little girl without drawing with a pencil by drawing with the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we had a group of people to benefit from another group of people.
So in this case, we had the severely disabled benefit from people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, thank you to be my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been approached by strange <unk> to express that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen to before my job had a public profile.
It was like I get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will inspire people to benefit from people with no disability.
They're there so that you can see them and think that things aren't that bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually really hard.
It <unk> some things.
But the things we <unk> aren't the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately <unk> because I was called the social model of disability, that tells us that we are more severely disabled, because of the society we live that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They simply are using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to do in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie, because we have sold this lie that the disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by something else.
And I don't really know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a little bit of <unk> to pick up the things that come to me --  <unk> the clever trick of how to load your battery out of your mobile phone on the battery in the chair.
Great.
We learn about force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lie that you have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A bunch of smiles to a brick of stairs has never made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen, I'm not going to show the subtitles for people who are <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in her bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered <unk> nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people who are disability that we are <unk> by getting up in bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about it is that it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please don't be <unk>
When people think of reality, they think in "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but Augmented reality is not science fiction.
Augmented reality is something that happens in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools to do it, and people need to know, because reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would stick with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the game game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> man who feels like a <unk> man trying to engage with everything of it.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I took some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not pictures of the practices of the <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology of emerging technology is an underwater climbing on the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, depending on the University of Washington.
<unk> of <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like the feeling of being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be your favorite players, and they've asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
<unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get from <unk> how we take it to the next level?
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the more realistic reality apparatus ever created, and it's not quite <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, sorry.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Oh my God!
CK: That is the experience of a man on a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What is the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan experience.
When he could be <unk> running through the <unk> and throw it into the bottom of the network?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain over 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not actually <unk>
It's actually virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
And I will understand reality when I <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> they put a <unk> to their <unk> of field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and then on the backs of the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
They just come out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
Augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information gets you to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information overload.
And so that <unk> the good teams of the bad guys.
So your team of computer will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data will stop being just <unk>
It would also be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's <unk>
<unk> your <unk> and <unk>
They went to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would notice that a defense behind you are going to be <unk> Normally, you don't <unk> but the <unk> system of <unk>
They would take the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. And the receptor sees it in its bombsight an area of grass that lights and change the career.
He <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The audience <unk> and fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field,
They want to be your favorite player.
Augmented reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show somebody how to literally be in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth of <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how likely, are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it true for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we make, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
And recently, I became <unk> after 23 years of service in <unk> <unk>
Most of those 23 years I spent the country <unk> the southern tip of <unk> County, which includes the <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The bridge <unk> <unk> was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer certified to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is basically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical, and <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such that the each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
<unk> impact your bones, some of which will make vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall in <unk> water and then <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this <unk> method will notice the <unk> death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel, parallel to a bridge.
This is where most people get to before they take their life.
I can tell you the experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the dark time, it's very difficult to bring them back to you.
I took this picture last year while this young year was talking to an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who were going to commit suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, politically and psychologists train the new official new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him over July 22 last year by receiving a call from a suicide bomber sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a <unk> officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to two times before from New Jersey to try to kill himself from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened up the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
Then Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and left.
This kind of kind of <unk> New Jersey boy had just taken her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see me how I was.
The parents of Jason had the order.
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What do you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved the suicide <unk>
What do you find?
So let me say?
In my experience, not just to speak, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like it feels because you probably don't think so.
It's just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about making their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to despair, despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do with the <unk> social isolation and a missing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read her his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of January, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and I picked up the <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but seeing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the game of 49 <unk> with his father 19 in January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
And the next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the Mike <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real infectious disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and travel the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I refer to hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a <unk> subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north tower.
I was looking at my <unk> and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he saw immediate <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the hour and the next one, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to come back and give life another chance.
When Kevin went back, he <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it mean to be <unk> and <unk> the hope and my life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You <unk>
You stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11 of March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
They went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
I really engaged in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her writing, <unk> when I visited San Francisco in San Francisco that night, you were <unk> as the patient.
I know I did have to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and of his depression with hope that his story to inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of the end of his own pain, reminded me the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, you wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and <unk> from the <unk>
The incidents of those incidents that I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And for that time, I was raising my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few that have jumped from the bridge, and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second one that they leave on the railing they realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connecting to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be working on to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you get into that?
I have to be something in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way.
When I became a model that I felt that I had ever achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth with my inside.
For complicated reasons, which I'm going to refer to later on, when I look at this picture, I think, we got it -- I was going to get it -- you know, <unk>
But the past October, I discovered is that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or by the beliefs of those who are around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, what is considered to be <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent, and so ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, my house, I would always put this shirt in the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
And I knew how to do it.
The gender has always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery of it.
Because of my success, I never taught me to share my story, not because I thought that I'm going to be a bad thing, but how the world comes to those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mama, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many of them are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in Indian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, I still wore a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> she was <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won the bathroom, I won <unk> and he was third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you teach the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I put two <unk> to my name.
She also sat with me when I was interested in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before we change the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but to me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move moving to New York, and be model.
Many of them are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but that <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global vigil for Mother's Day <unk>
I am on this stage thanks to a long story of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there's no more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. Of course, thank you to all my <unk>
My own network of support, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I have been to young women who had <unk> and sometimes when they were calling me and tell me that his parents couldn't take it, I took the phone, and I said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
And sometimes it works -- other don't. It's just identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes that task is not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In many different societies, and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> his efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when when you're born, your birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, not by his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes from, gives her <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother became a lot of <unk> a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he was born, her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the <unk> mother, but the daughter <unk> the daughter <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you have to go home and school paintings at his siblings.
At the age of 12 years, in some sense, it has a good life.
It can be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you take them to go out of his house without a male.
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you will, the code of the course honor, I could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of course.
And there is a norm more than societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts people's decisions and their mother and choices -- even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If it was very young, you have to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> her daughter and the same lesson for his children.
And this cycle goes on, and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me extremely <unk>
And so before I started thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a legendary <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I got a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when I was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years old.
Can you be wondering why I should mention the gift of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
A library to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them was able to go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when he <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason that I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason why value my daughter.
What my father was not able to give my sisters and his daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to do it in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education to <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned from going to school.
The women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At 10 years, <unk> got up and lifted up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, he was offered her himself for New York Times, and he spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign, and nine o'clock in October 2012, he was shot to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell my wife to my wife and <unk> <unk> so he passed my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please don't get you."
<unk> the fair cause.
It <unk> your life in play because of the truth of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you become <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These very few words we would spend a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When he was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm fine with my smile, <unk> and <unk> on my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please do not <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
It <unk> when he doesn't end up.
They fight with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's in my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the group of Google <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about here today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you put it into a brain operation to you.
Are you still as smart or not?
It won't be like this, you can go back to <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much of a dozen chemical <unk> every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about <unk> and mix of chemicals, and try to keep it with life.
More than once I've saved a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would try to get the dose <unk> because it doesn't really exist a clear map that I say in <unk>
I started testing different mix -- and I was surprised when you see how small changes in the dose were dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was like, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a typical dose and typical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was surprised when I saw my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I was thinking all the time on sex, and I believed that it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past, I've met several types of this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had the front, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't afford it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to do, I mean, I've been better with men.
What I was trying to do as we can adjust those hormones and those hormones and so forth, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my thought, my thinking, my <unk>
I used to think almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference point, how do you get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who are talking about this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works -- to me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> really, really <unk> sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to carry these mental images from my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director were able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we are quite close to this with two recent experiments that have been done by two groups that in neuroscience.
Both of these used technology -- image imaging picture, to represent the brain here, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person's brain looking at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while being <unk> looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column in the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is named Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large pool of the brain in front of video sequences.
And then I showed you a movie with new images, new animals, new animals, and as much as they were getting together, a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain information of a scanning thing to show you what seemed like the person was seeing.
You can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This keeps us <unk>
We are very close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning brain systems available today, and its resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new projection techniques from images, including me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the <unk> first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution, not gains for thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of magnets bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a vast amount of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets, right?
Yet most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in mosquitos and frequency receptors in the MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field of a magnetic field or <unk> patterns in pristine radio frequencies that are <unk>
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio radio processing patterns, we can increase mass <unk> information that can be taken out of a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide into layers of our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid, but the <unk> of the hormones and the <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas into direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and disease.
We have a few options that open up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you this night about the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay story.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may be telling some person for the first time you want a love or telling someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other conversation difficult for which you have <unk> in life.
So all of this is a difficult conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like to happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And to be the slope of the <unk> of my pants <unk> and I got my head <unk> I was a little bit, I would say, usually a child would say, "Hey, you're a <unk> or <unk>
And he would appear to be silent silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother <unk> a cold her child.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I wouldn't have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
An family silence -- but this time was ready to get it full of the female issues at the table.  He had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even an excerpt from the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I went down and my backs and my back a four year-old girl with a pink dress staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a little girl or <unk>
And so I took it deep back, again, I got out of <unk> about her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
All right, I am more than <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I was both <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels like a <unk>
That's how my closet is not different than yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why to come out of my closet was harder than coming out of your hand, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explain to someone who has declared on bank banking is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I tell is more difficult than telling your five-year-old than you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's just the hard thing.
We have to stop classifying what is difficult to deal with about how difficult to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
Somewhere in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made of, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that he had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the lesbian <unk> <unk> to fight any <unk> for coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay grenade -- and the move only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my personal friends, strangers I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill.
One of my Christmas launches was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of us were invited to know that I was gay, and when I was doing my wife's lady <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> you ever found in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite <unk>
Our favorite show Will <unk> and Grace could.
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing you desperately to get me to know that I was on my support, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the Scud <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how difficult conversations are still my strong point.
Ask for anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand what it means to come out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others have to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Sean <unk> Just <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, they die.
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate their truth.
It will never be solved by that.
And some of you can get out of the injured hurt -- because they have done, but I'll never be proud of what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark closet to you: a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thanks, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that the question of if a machine can think about is as interesting as the <unk> question can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of science <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the underlying physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you're forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the understanding of the physics of intelligence.
So in this program that led to several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, into a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be honed for developing intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will address the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the ecosystem of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to do complex assignments.
And so, taking all of these different things and <unk> together, I asked, from a number of years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever saw.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a <unk> F, which acts in order to maximize future freedom freedom.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open options with a little force -- with the diversity of possible future accessible, yeah, even an impending time, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
Creativity is trying to maximize future freedom of action and keep the open.
And so having in account this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
We understand the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should be able to make more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes out of it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy and long-term entropy in any system in which you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could happen multiple tests of animal intelligence, play games, and even earn money <unk> actions, everything without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically using a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He simply decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have apps for humanoid robotics and human technology.
This ability for tools will have apps in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is broadly applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> your potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections into a social network where our friends are constantly <unk> and keeps a successful net going.
This is the same capacity for network <unk> it also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the pathways of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is broadly applicable to problems in defense for logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of simulated <unk> to successfully increase assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management ability will have broad applications in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance, in finance,
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of cognitive cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom freedom.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term of the robot, <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were born, intelligent machines, would have a <unk> rebellion in it.
Machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion -- in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking the control, instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of goal.
They often ask me, ask me, how do you look for goals like this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of helping them build <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, it's the following: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the turn of stars and lose the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures faint light intensity when planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light that will go.
The data gathered by Kepler showing the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are among them and their mother.
Together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small, <unk> as the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of fictional worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest record.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on global scale, have <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I am not a weather scientist and the weather, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, hoping to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
Could you say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more we look at planets like the Earth, the most enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet recently discovered and the planets we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world showing this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and partly is why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking its surface to look for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> satellites like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> and <unk> ideas compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the Earth's areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places in the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag a large and sad <unk> the belief and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> Earth.
So I like <unk> exploration, I disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars is going to be there to safeguarding humanity is as to imagine that the captain of the Titanic to tell us that the party will actually have place later in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for exploration exploration and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces the same <unk> the goal of <unk> to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They're only getting closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and sustain spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, maybe we can get the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked, did you realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider the notion of the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we have to <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and exploration, they can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to <unk> the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would spend my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could look at the window that was at the dining table where I had them <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and all were <unk>
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early in Europe in the next morning, and I went back to my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure that it's not more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought, well despite the circumstances, I was working on.
I'm a neurologist, a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rhythm, but the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in their place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen.
So I started thinking about that, but even a month later, my thoughts would not exist.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winning the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked to him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and I had forgotten that I had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight
This is something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes up and tries to figure out what was wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might be able to go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious.
In the house, you get a place for things that are pretty easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish, which places the trees, which places that are the tribes that are living in and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find out their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys on your car, glasses and <unk>
So at home you would get a place for keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a drawer in particular.
For your reading goggles a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take your cell phone a picture of your credit card license, passport, <unk> by mail to themselves in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face to a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved person, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of medical decisions and in fact for making it for financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take out of a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today.
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask that most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor wouldn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's fault -- it's scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> which is what you think is?
How many people have to take it before they help somebody else?
300.
This according to the research of researchers cynical <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently of <unk>
And I just <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, or the brain or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 to lower my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects. Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things that are powerful muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, five percent are not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how we do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking about the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out exposure to your drug to help the drug.
I don't say they had or don't take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The health ethic is reliable is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air <unk> but actually this number necessary to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that the most is done in the older men in 50, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to deal with is <unk>
That's how 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent effects just one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue to you that we're going to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think of the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain into the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or your immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it's not going to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be able to be those <unk> to put systems in the place that helps to minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things to the first place.
<unk> at night in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor settled on a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the door of entry in the same, an easy way of it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of mail I haven't read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite song.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never going to be silent.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of sign -- <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade of 1800, and over time, mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So it has a <unk> story.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country tracking their rules, and <unk> behaviors and norms.
So how do I understand this?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating sure you don't know the <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, which is why it's coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> to decide.
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> don't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> and <unk>
In the culture -- the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to give me more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be that way.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all that I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and do it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency, social currency.
In my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could get it <unk>
I chose I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language of speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
That way I'm capable of being relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when I ask <unk> his voices, I'm able to hold a temporary form of value something like taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue to do with this practice, I feel that I could get it in the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signs of sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide up in many different parameters.
If it's mapping a different <unk> for each finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, the speed, the form of hand and like that, while you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if you look at the <unk>
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers <unk> to express a clear concept or a <unk> idea.
If only one key will change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens to the music in terms of <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and push it over and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you <unk> and <unk> the visual speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel like the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express change in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> so much time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rhythm for <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands at the top.
Now we're going to do that both in the head like his chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this: Please do it with me again.
And now this is now.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Now look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest but they carry very different meanings on.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to begin to question what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, no sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn to learn, not to learn to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to show you to open your ears, opening your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "Can you take everything, but then you have to get it <unk>
Aid involves responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a ignorance bubble I must say, because adults lied to protect us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not really good at cleaning the others.
Time spent now I'm an adult and teach citizen and invention in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, <unk> the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to look under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But hard an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge boats as well.
So together with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the children very <unk> can also be involved.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great, and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it with my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to push them into something that we expect it to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot of the robots.
Then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And let's transform light and web cameras and put it into a floating robot that will move through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a range of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would give it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're trying to go right away.
I can ask my problem <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, the Internet, the Internet, and you would get into this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just by using hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk> forest.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where you go to the place where you live.
You can see also that water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown color and when it all <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be able to be able to get through all sorts of substances that produce different spectra of what can help identify what in the water.
So we had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help each other children.
I was forced to do a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that <unk> several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, nuclear power in the water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation is missing from the Japanese coast, and most of them -- it is pretty much -- it looks safe, is blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and researching independent way with other scientists, the soil, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course I didn't have the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we informed the center of <unk> you see the use of <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take the job seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day, and we talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> and <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> we introduced <unk> to represent real time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And so we were able to notice that the radioactive powder would be <unk> from the top of the mountain to the system <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closest to nuclear power to date.
We get up to 1.5 miles from the nuclear center, and with the fishermen of fishermen we were collecting the <unk> of the sea floor with a tracking device as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technology.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> we find an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we made it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal -- a little bit of biology, in which you basically can build almost around there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where people's dreams can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or do we help in mobility at the age of advanced transforming their standard wheels in new electric vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy that we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect the kids of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned with the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of iron pieces of steel, the one of one silk silk silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic thing.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing he believed.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
<unk> was only <unk> <unk>
But living ones are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took the whole information required for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have <unk> a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find some <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with small <unk>
You mostly acts as a filter, the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that varies its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my vision of the world -- the double personality.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analytics and synthesis, it shows up on the two screens after me.
My job, at the simplest level is trying to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why was it not possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where they have four disciplines that offers designers to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm in diameter with an effective basis that one day not very far out of 24 meters in diameter with an advanced basis that one day not very far out of <unk> <unk> which glow in the darkness.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every waking is a single size of the light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion cycle of Paris with <unk> they're going to be <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with musical printing questions, we printed this layer and 3D <unk> <unk> between cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a dopamine scanner.
That designers have access to this analytical of high resolution, and the <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the comfortable chair and also absorb sound.
Professor Carter and my collaborator, <unk> went back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern -- it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There's no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jew home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and actually define a lot of what matters to me.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
I often wonder, "What would the design look like if objects did a single <unk>
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material to do the kind of material in the tree of the tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune into your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> of <unk> <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical <unk> we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the large-scale structures -- they built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures made from a single three material 3.5 feet long, 100 percent recyclable.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it down, to find a natural form in the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a by-product of the impression that it was used to contain <unk> <unk> which first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> problems to mesh and if it extends even more, even more.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of husks of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed for <unk> <unk> <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothing to maintain the life for <unk>
To do that, we should master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> we did our own table, new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> <unk> made <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels inside of so small stations.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothes, we were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other use sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution of design.
In order to contain these relationships, we created a unique channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help us flow these bacteria and make it back to their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, it would make more transparent channels ...
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretch out from one another, it takes 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are living creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, <unk> the subjective tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology of it.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer printed stuff in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture.
The manufacturing is not going to be done about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers into each other.
And this is going through the scales.
The silk worm is very <unk> in the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch of a box, not within a box, we realized that we would <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that form, the composition, the <unk> structure of the <unk> <unk> directly through the environment.
And so often, <unk> silk worms are so often in their <unk> their silk <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we can shape silk stark without boiling one <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making of silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms are <unk> and that's why we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, integrating silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms of silk <unk>
And after I went back four weeks, they were prepared with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they would get eggs, and they got eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much higher.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
So by <unk> biological silk -- <unk> <unk> give this entire pavilion, which we integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms of silk -- <unk> miles away.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the path of silk.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must join these two visions of the world.
Which leads us to turn, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by nature to be inspired by the very first time, that we have to make us charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but he had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and art and spent websites, also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to try and try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I would let myself get out of it, and I feel <unk> I have found that <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me much anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to pick up one thing, denied all my own passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I made so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me because of anything.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me to have asked me to have asked me then.
Ask yourself, where they learned to allocate meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where it <unk> you learned from culture.
You ask yourself, "What do you want to be about <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what you were talking about.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers on kids like <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow various shapes, it <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to go to the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be about <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of before you take away the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by kids to dream with what might be, not inspires to dream everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the other thing, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults do well -- maybe you're going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> <unk> is very <unk> in our culture.
This is this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to be involved in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are lots of different issues that wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that I want to do?
There's no place for somebody in that framework.
And so you can feel itself.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interest and creative activities.
It's a breath of <unk>
It could help if you divide into three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms.
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It <unk> any term you like or <unk> your own self.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with an identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> that you must win.
But what I've learned to talk to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths as being in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in another data visualization for data, traveling and mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired inspired <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is <unk>
When we put them into something, we're going to do it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> by having been many times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we have -- so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and writer <unk>
As a young pianist had an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known ones.
Before I become a writer, <unk> was a city planner,
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when it was starting their practices, and this ability helps to write compelling amounts for the editors facility.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you would give to you even if you finally got it.
It's possible to apply knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower -- <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the head of videos, other old, <unk> designer pages, sometimes consultant to a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes it feels James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take out various roles depending on your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, <unk> learning, three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster to <unk> them to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have <unk> right now, and we need to have conventional creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart.
They came out of the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into deep and put ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that are dealing with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> most of them will tell you that they're just more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing you can take from this talk, I hope that it is this: Get out of the internal wiring is whatever.
If you are a heart doctor, then you go through all media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a happier and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world <unk> us.
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> brought it to a psychiatric psychiatric car.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
But even more surprisingly,
If I had been living today, I couldn't give her more help than he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They've been discovered and antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections, many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But a little bit of progress has become progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's may be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that your years is going to be given Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or to be loved with Alzheimer's.
Already in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs will increase an increase in five times in 2050, as the generation gets older.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest health and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or even slow down its development.
We get less than Alzheimer's than we do more than Alzheimer's than we have invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer cancer that Alzheimer's cancer despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the years, all of the years, the scientists -- confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will become <unk> in an ordinary and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy healthy brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to spark a severe loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused significantly increased life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We know today are made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these dots -- they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are going to get out there.
So this makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large <unk> <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what step block is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that goes on, and then create a drug that does.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the cables and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that flies specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> worms -- and you can see it moves normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that they stick with each other, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at early stage, then we see it <unk> and they live a normal life.
So this is just an extraordinary result: but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's all about you.
We must argue that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we can, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have topped more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to progress in HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk to themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and they help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the spine of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by testing it as a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers will be <unk> to make 36 questions more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you had another person?
And <unk>
<unk> -- these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me Tell your partner what you like from him or it, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really really really really really really really struck me, the gossip that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with somebody who I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
Yet we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send him to the spine when I was going to go into a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask, follow them together.
And the reason I think this is <unk> this is because they've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
And one week before I had the article <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had taught me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can get to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But he had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, he had been called the Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million <unk> and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with a <unk> of experience, but another thing is to discover that life love from one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, the same question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick quest on the mailbox with the phrase, <unk> <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where's your <unk>
And I immediately got a red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable and ask about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
36 questions seemed to have <unk> their own life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both make a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and <unk> orders of all of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process -- a range that I didn't feel at all about.
And I understand that people didn't want to know whether the study worked really -- they wanted to know if it really was <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking at foster interpersonal approach, between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds good, right?
But the study worked.
The participants had felt more close to doing that -- several studies later -- also used <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of police and community members and they've used it between <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you would tell you about the person who was going to do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she only wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that they do get better to get better after testing the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was almost all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or could I live without it.
So I was focusing on science.
And so I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just studied for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was built with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I used to feel as bad as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I was.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than to reasonably make me demand me.
What I look for love is a <unk> not just to be a little <unk> and being <unk> I think they will be a little <unk> for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told you about 36 questions is that there may be a short <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very dubious story, because in love we feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story version of the story is still together?
And his content with an answer from <unk> or No.
So more than a question, would propose to ask more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who your love deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love in love when things become <unk> and how to know when cutting and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in your partner?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a well-known day, and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we are tracking us still together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same as being <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article, love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it is not true, but because at the moment, there was no idea what that choice.
I didn't think I would have both of them that make that decision, and how much times I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone as a kind of kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think of.
And what we <unk> and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy happy ending to be implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and I was raised as a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a time.  Something that really hit me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
It took a box of wood, and <unk> a dollar, and a dollar, and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has a grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
So at a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go to field and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, the <unk> I wrapped the prayer and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and he was <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, and thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened.
So I did? I built <unk>
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, and these strange bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing the same as you do about a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals <unk>
First, <unk> of the ones you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was so much fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend over for example, to go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form of sculptures of resin natural size with drawings of humans inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to drawing on a window, then in another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years for years, and my work would come with something very big, that I call <unk>
By <unk> I was inspired by a large measure in <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
<unk>
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 thousand pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with heads of animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama Bin Laden, there's all sorts of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
In all ways also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand, whereas in the other hand, they get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a tail of snake that joins the <unk>
But anyway, his tail turn fire into a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made of terrorist cards.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if you were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material and material be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in the form of being human, and they travel in <unk> <unk> <unk> at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, divide up.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being caught inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to be familiar with the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of his chest, and it covers the penis or whatever it is, one kind of thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that comes out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside that <unk> <unk>
Can you think about it.
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a a musician, a writer, a <unk> a museum, a museum, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries of the religion, does not work.
We're all very much made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that a pill against pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
So I'm going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug has ever been possible in the body.
The disadvantage -- however, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are being able to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the account of skeletal cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on its own negative, because in the time that it takes to the race to the blood -- it becomes <unk> and worse even for the time that you take to reach its destiny, which is where it is more important, in the HIV storage of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the swollen system, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood flow of the patients that are <unk> to regular drug therapy.
However, after treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the big problem with HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life run by by oral <unk>
One day, I felt and I thought, <unk> make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for careful wounds and diabetes surgery, you can be used for anything else -- including the drug transportation.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open up or drill holes, extremely small holes, opening up and close the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small little laser beam on the cellular membrane on the HIV membrane as that these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> at the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, he runs to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, puts it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look like a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> investigator in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups in armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
And what they do is what these groups do when they're not <unk>
And my goal is to understand better to understand these foreign agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to nonviolent <unk>
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be an <unk> of states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of <unk> peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> was signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict.
But how do we do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and the policies have not been <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent heritage against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s -- <unk> also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks versus Israel, also runs the <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking people.
They put a complex piece of communication machine, radio stations TV, online Internet websites and strategy in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools -- they run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not safe and safety and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by the war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a rising price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at groups of <unk> we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill out gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups are involved in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated and sophisticated organizations, are these organizations, we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a landscape, running all its function, collect the trash system run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak the states, like in the Middle East today, the most intervene and they fill that gap.
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups have to invest more than military tools.
<unk> that vacuum of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we understand better to groups -- we will understand what incentives offer to foster the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, the power of military power can win some battles, but not to give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that <unk> of security that allowed these groups to thrive that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist woman.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I fear openly the label tag -- would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I was looking at me as a bad man."
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and they hated sexual <unk> as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated -- women around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people when I could be a feminist.
It will be labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant.
It <unk> me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine being another person.
And over time, as I was growing, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminist -- and also, proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It would take the same pay.
We have the right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have the right to use a very easy way and accessible the contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have on account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We're people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We have to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When you go to work, listen to work, rap <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades into the women and it offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang -- it's amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> for my musical storytelling.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects -- the waste of garbage -- the <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies from the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, is his choice, and I am not who to judge.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, <unk> that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
I know this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the gay workers, and <unk> in favor of white women and high class.
<unk> if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist thing.
Also, the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we will make it seamlessly.
When we get older, we take a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative people and leaders in the sector, are afraid of being <unk> like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what that tag is <unk> fear cannot be able to fulfill the little realistic.
Take <unk> or <unk>
In the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> in <unk> acted in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to this star <unk> embracing feminism and making women and young men who be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> time, cultural critics began endless arguments if they were <unk> it was not quite a feminist thing.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to take a lot beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until there's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Evil feminism, or more <unk> is the <unk> point.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy by providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make the change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equal equality we all deserve to be and our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want it to grow up in a world.
Where they were <unk> by their strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be used as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the play.
We can change the radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't treat women as well as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in their magazine to participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate in making decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to engage engaging in this kind of projects, we can also inspire them to be even more like us to be <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision jobs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top of the people in the power of directors, and producers of film and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim with courage to be good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
And a few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't tell me to believe something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, and I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could <unk> and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I hold the hard reality that I am just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when more you need to be a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had been <unk> by having visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the amazing things about this outbreak is that <unk> which may be fatal to a child with an immune system, is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and <unk> <unk> <unk> and marked by being a fraud.
They don't think most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that the vaccines actually put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase in autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard of her create all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued stable only three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> fundraising <unk> refer to routinely autism as an epidemic as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people of the Center for Disease Control and so what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> so much of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his son of two years, eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what country has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health care.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist with <unk> Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that looked like <unk> worlds -- private, private worlds -- even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey of panic by <unk> as when they don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the base of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the topic, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as they were collecting references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures -- but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children sent out by other doctors to be <unk> without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
It <unk> autism as a form of child psychotic and <unk> parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've been careful in a refrigerator <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in his clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before he was <unk>
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he said correctly he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s began to prove the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were John <unk> and <unk> and they had a very deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed <unk> without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend at the National Forest Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
I had a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find kids autistic in the community.
What you saw clearly that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were lying in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genealogy of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in nice pictures and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but I avoided my own <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was talking German, and he <unk> him for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as <unk> disability for life that required <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead of treating the kids in their clinic as patients, as they were calling them their little teachers, and he got to help in the development of methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that <unk> amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were commonplace, and they always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in the pop culture as the social social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with it that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that we <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the late '80s, and early '90s, their changes entered <unk> in <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by broad and <unk>
These changes don't fell on <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I got out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> acting of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, there were the first easy clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that they were, by making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that they <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the rise of diagnosis. A simple, seductive and seductive story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of the prevention that one in every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, is right, the autistic are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, people have come together on the Internet to reject the idea that they're puzzles for solving by the new medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
No doubt, people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most civil aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers who are ability, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
