You know what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather clothing.
I'm here to talk to you today about circles.
And you know that <unk> is usually something that fell in some place.
You only have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the years in the middle school, in <unk> where I was the rare of the class.
When you go to bleeding every week in the bathroom of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when she walked into the bathroom of the operating room.
He did it for secret to it.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars -- and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who are fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone phone from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I am <unk> that of adults never got to know that.
You might be able to go down to Ohio and please bring that guy that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to do it with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
So we found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of his family, because it was necessary, for it.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed a circle -- it had become a circle -- and that <unk> that I told you about was done in the face itself.
<unk> is that death is a part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
He needs truth and beauty and I'm very happy that I talked about a lot of this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went to the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them to my <unk> of water about 60 feet -- and I was not going to be able to think about a <unk> about another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or break down the ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality, on it.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to embrace them, and they hold up to the end, while others can't afford them more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated from each other and themselves, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing your <unk> atmosphere.
As it melts a iceberg released water freshwater rich in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are only in that way, and they won't exist again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of your way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 thousand years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's just frequent to actually see a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the form of iceberg and your <unk>
You can see here, it begins to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so you know, the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in sentences -- the same day, exactly at the same time, every one would be a baby.
So two couples each with a child.
I don't want it to be too much in the details of the conception, because if you stop thinking about conception -- I'm not going to pay me attention.
Think about it for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome. and of sperm is attached to the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X of sperm is attached to the X chromosome.
Both of them, and it starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity in the ground to be two <unk>
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way that people are, the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have thought of fluid -- the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is the <unk> as a <unk> of patients or, as I say, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy the social norms.
I've been working, for example, with <unk> twins, two people within a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much longer than average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physics doesn't fit into the male <unk> and conventional <unk>
In general lines -- we can <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that is not <unk> in common forms of male or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene of the chromosome. And it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that are <unk>
And then in the life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But since this individual doesn't have a pathway of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops on a course of a <unk> course.
When you look at the baby it has a little girl.
It's a young girl.
And often, it's not about puberty, but until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when somebody realizes something is going on.
After doing tests they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's actually not that way.
Cities like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone, <unk>
Most women like I -- I consider a <unk> woman -- it doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think to be a typical woman most of the women as I are sensitive to the <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone as I have the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life as a boy and I had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had a very extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk>
He had <unk> chromosomes and <unk> the <unk> glands were so active that in essence, creating a robotic environment.
As a result, his genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component of a male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk>
And it went to the 19 years when he started having a medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes with chromosomes -- develop what is known as <unk> -- that is, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> or <unk> to surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health for the same physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you go to a number of surgeries that are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have a <unk> identity -- it will be black -- it means to have African anatomy in a historical terms.
A profound idea of simplistic.
And when you have a body that shows something pretty different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture to the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people within a body.
The most higher case is last year with the <unk> South <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What test are you going to do to determine if it's <unk> <unk> or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that don't have such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and women and women and <unk> we are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought they were stable categories of stable categories that would be driven directly with <unk> categories -- they are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you do -- the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science -- we are getting more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all sorts of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at first and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are really <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> to when somebody is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to get it to this question of if someone was dead.
As a lot of a pen in front of the nose and if it was still not <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we have to address the dilemma of determine really the death of someone. And this puts us into a difficult situation, where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion explosion could be happy to somebody like me.
In politics I'm liberal, <unk> to people with positive bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from the perspective of democracy.
And to tell you about this model first -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so sweeping in what they do, that I find out every little bit of seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is completely <unk>
It's for what happened in <unk> with <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you can all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue <unk>
They were from the idea that it came to the political power for the right of blood transmitted from the grandfather passed the father and then the son, so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and they replace it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They set up the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common anatomy and not <unk> -- that was a very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were <unk> two things.
He was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- the science.
And it gets very clear -- if you look at the history of Parents -- that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations -- and therefore we have <unk> the concept of being able to be passed through a kind of a kind of a <unk> right idea.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look back, for example, the Declaration of Islam, they talk about nature and God's God.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And by consequence they were spreading the idea of <unk> <unk>
And, in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of civil rights.
They didn't think about it, but it was so cool.
And what happened years next?
And the women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
Again, the color people who are going to join the <unk> coincidence about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights for a human.
I don't mean that we had <unk> in order to estimate it.
I don't want to say that at age five years they were supposed to have sex with sex or married.
And there are some divisions <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep sense and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at first of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's figure out that one of them, Argentina, was born three months before period, the June June of 1980.
So if it was the opposite, born in term: a March March 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary was attributed to all of the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it's born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I don't have told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the adage that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Bring them on their hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in a number of aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we got to the point of having to have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude -- "Well, we have to make the line somewhere, so we're going to do it.
But many people have caught up in a rare position.
For example, Texas has decided to get married with a man you don't have to have chromosome. and you have to marry a woman -- you have to have chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't make tests that are going to be able to do tests to people.
But this is also very strange, because the story I told you about at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I would have a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we had to do it -- in this for <unk> rights to people, because I've got to admit that I know that I know about some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> and smart <unk> and <unk> about their sexual relations that people I know.
So how do you put the theme of the <unk> content.
It's very difficult.
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed to a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago I had made a couple of years ago that had made a couple of <unk> twins, and then pick them up and so on.
But when the phone asked her the case of the operation -- it was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So what I said, "Well, has considered the political <unk> instead of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to the people to be who are without <unk> to change the <unk>
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to end up I mean I have been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it could have been, if we had ever been, if we had a lot more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a hammer and I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, because I've been interested in the <unk> I have been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the difference between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies, is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relations and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my glad I knew I was interested in feminism -- I was interested in <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
feminism has to do with rid of rid of <unk> tea, so there's nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I've ever thought about his question, I have a little bit like there's a woman in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain, and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relations and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if you ask them, they were very open to find a way to protect people from the state of the state, that we may have been able to put more attached to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when you have a democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the body body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
And so while we try to create a cheaper way, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007 year I decided we had to rethink how we think about the economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new dying.
Well, at this moment we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have a single city willing to do it.
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily take it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it would just take it out of apartments.
Imagine half that half of those who would want to live in apartments -- they might be owners, and that you can have the other half of them in order to do that.
You could try to augment the ability to make it <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you think is that those buildings and the areas around them, have norms to avoid the <unk> and the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all these <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, to build a building of new apartments that is totally new, always and when the standards of that place is going to make it <unk>
So I suggested that governments will have new reform zones to hold up cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 percent, they will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened for a human <unk>
In the next few elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we have <unk> reforms and at the same time.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under its ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those norms that say you can't go and save all the same residents in apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies as a norms of norms for <unk> and usually are the norms that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we sat together in Miami in a conference room.
I tried to tell you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City that in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk would describe in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> and a choice so people can choose if you want to go under those norms.
So the president of <unk> me, and he told me that we had to do this project, and this is important, this could be the path so our country forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 kilometers of square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk> world.
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress went to the platform and said, "Mr. <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down, and they showed the <unk>
And this explained to you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles from distance to the North.
And also new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would require <unk> countries that could benefit from countries that are associated with the countries that will help them to establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all be confident that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be able to cover a thousand kilometers away.
And shortly later, the 19th of January <unk> they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a human available that allowed to create these special development regions.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the vote in the Congress of this human <unk> was from <unk> to one.
And all of them, all of them, all of them are happening in society, the <unk>
By the way, you have to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17, he passed over again on the other hand, from <unk> to one.
Immediately after the vote of the 21 to 24 of February, a shift from about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Africa.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in Korea, is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there were built in four years, after four years of getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would enable the <unk> and it could operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing her Court to be the last court for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some of the funding.
But the only thing we know you've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that want to be able to go into the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone. And there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world, there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it immediately to another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job -- sometimes they are imaginary mothers who have to win money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are children who are trying to meet their parents that haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what seems to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to insist so that families can choose between a number of cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends had asked me to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there are inside, I'm going to make a confession to public <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, photographing and post that in my blog, <unk> colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
<unk> stores, let me reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know how general my money is going to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
Do you like color to me.
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive -- then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes -- and nothing else.
<unk> for exactly a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else I'd like to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walks at TED,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you this week.
Doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
This is called a brilliant cats.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see it from less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> it took me back, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be of bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> integration is <unk>
I've spent a long time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you a little bit of you, you know, you will be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you have inside.
Sometimes, sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost secure that you are.
And if you think you don't think about something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside you don't look at it that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for no one of this audience.
We have to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal form of personal and only a great way to tell the world about you without having to say a word.
I tried it over and over again, when people were approaching this week, just for what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate anything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another crazy crazy, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart, and I look at it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side -- which is the logical part and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you have a scale to measure the <unk> of each other, we could design a plan of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical for example.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain on this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extreme people, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something -- with a big <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that each other.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that as most of the other quantum quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite a intuition to make things really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play things.
We set up to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You can have a intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says one thing can be only in a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound rare to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a <unk>
I was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the game of playing with that bar of parking spaces, taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the great things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great model model that you can have in the world, except you're a physicist of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a physicist of particles, because they don't play with the car bars, play with these strange particles.
And when you play with your particles, you discover that they do all sorts of rare things -- like they can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point there was the physics of a few years ago, you needed quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around each day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition. And maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it also didn't fit right to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the small particles are following the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be all following the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why I should not should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I set myself to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to extend it a little bit of it in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a metal, a form of springboard and which is <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a brand again, and I went to work all over the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> form that is underneath the device.
So this device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for that for some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable is being on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare, but then when other people go back to do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that the symmetrical objects behave in the same way.
<unk> <unk> are not only people, but it's all the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to hit all the other anywhere.
And that's what we did.
So the lights -- and then you get a <unk> and pulled it up all the air, and then you turn it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero at all.
Now, when you're only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like wants.
So we measured their movements.
And we discovered it was moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way I <unk> was like a breath in this form -- as a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth feature, we could make it <unk> and that you don't have to go down at the same time -- something that is happening with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
So what does it mean that a <unk> thing -- and I don't know at the same time?
Think about atoms.
In a case, all the share of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is all the sheet of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.

<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because look at this, the difference on scale.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places.
I mean, it's my logical piece of <unk>
So imagine if you were in many places at the same time, how would you be that?
How do you make your consciousness.
There's another part of history.
And this is when we put it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we found that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition. seemingly all the objects in the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- it claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and let me do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me 18 months old.
A lot of negotiations and stories would be done by 17 very interesting museums -- nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story has been explains just in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I don't have a lot of education -- but I had no access to many of these museums and art art.
So when I began to travel and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do that.
Better to show you the demo, and then you tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So let's go back, we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are there.
There's the gallery gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite, to the <unk> of New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there, and it <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the top flat, and, with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
Let's go forward. That was <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> signal.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million below.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million ways.
It can go around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are going on.
I love this boy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went in, and I found that children were actually playing with something.
It was a little bit, I spoke to some of the people of the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is a <unk> with a stick stick with a stick of <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get it even deeper and you can see that you can really be able to get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take you into the image, so you can see what you are.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to go to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how you're born, I actually created this work.
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can play your own museum, create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just got around here.
It's about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things are not come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they don't have come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium it does justice to your art work, and it's represented properly online.
And the great question that make me today is, "You can do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to replace the experience.
And that's all. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everyone.
I have something to show you.
Think about it a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it a sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, all the children in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that has happened something very interesting in the racing race in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula one, take a budget and put it to a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what engineering, in engineering, the control system of real control.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that public control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers to the free air.
And, as <unk> they're starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can tell apart that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but it represents 50 percent of the world's population.
Now, 75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are in our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for <unk> for the <unk>
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's like most of all the atoms were going to become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outer environment.
In some sense it's almost like in the old <unk> <unk>
You know, when songs. <unk> the <unk> -- it says that at the end of the <unk> he took the hammer on the Moses -- and you can still see a little dent in <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and they had something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you -- they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The time line is on the top.
By the early time, there are people over here and doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time End of time.
First time -- a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah.
That night everyone was going to go to the center.
There's the great peak.
The next day, everyone was at the center of the British team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time I <unk> the people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done just a few years.
Another example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and we use.
Today, we know everything about the collection of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how is <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the garbage in its shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage -- and then we start to <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that did not exist.
There's a lot of complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we throw doesn't disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet, that's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the bottle of plastic that we throw on a day is still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is going on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water use in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, coming to that?
And one of the ideas that we develop at MIT, in a page was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> vacuum valves that open and <unk>
It creates a curtain of water, with water water.
If you go down the pixels -- you can write patterns, I'll show patterns patterns, images.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we could see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it the <unk> of it.
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors and windows -- but when you go up and open up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be somebody in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost all of the architecture of all of the architecture.
Here it is working.
It looks at the <unk> people for what happens inside.
And here I am myself trying to do not be able to show the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact there had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opened up to leave you -- but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes of water and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because of engineers, designers, we always think about the use people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and every one had a little pixel that it changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in the space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, we could form this field.
A kind of flexible display like this with a regular display in two dimensions.
Or, in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, what change is the light, not the position of the phone.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the display appear at different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can close, and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw earlier.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of the people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world's best dancers dancers -- the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk>
On the left you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> in real time as a motion capture.
It can take the whole movement.
You can go through the entire path.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people to get people to do something and change our <unk> environment like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make all of them a little bit of a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened over the last couple years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, the power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may like to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how would happen from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involves doing this together, form together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And these particles are water, while in our cloud are below.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered in the ocean.
You can move inside the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from below, serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So that's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, as a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
They would like to be better than these are these?
Suppose you would tell you that, with only a lot of changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better shape, to have a lot more <unk>
They would like to be more attractive and insurance <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe there are those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose anything?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the amount of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would make memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a theme here at the TED conference but I want to give you the eye of a doctor on the subject.
The great fan of the 20th century -- <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the <unk> Church -- he wrote an essay named <unk> in biology makes sense, except for the light of the <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end is, of course, that we're most interested in us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimps about six or eight million years.
There's been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it is the same protein, but it is the same one?
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all take in the bacteria more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully controlled environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm is very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that can want to want to be no effort for them.
It's really like a quick thing for the bacteria with occasional disruption of some rush to the output.
But for us, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential for our life.
They actually help digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would we tell us?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is as a brief <unk> the animal kingdom as one single and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk so I hope you have <unk>
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by <unk> and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two stem cells.
But when the organisms happen, things are starting to change.
It goes into the <unk>
And something very important, with the onset of sexual reproduction that goes on the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction in fact.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student -- I thought, well, <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but every year that was happening every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits your door of hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him and he finds a <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He says, "Well, George, said, "I take the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to make us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of spending the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of like <unk> <unk> to send the genetic burden on the next level of <unk> and then let us fall to the sea.
I think all of them, I think that all of them, I think all of the feeling that expressed <unk> Allen when he said, "I want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to be <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily matter for longevity.
It doesn't necessarily take the bigger or the stronger or the faster or even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean of the ocean bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be able to survive if there were fish there, fish insert it into a vacuum, yet they've managed to make it a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if you look forward at the time, I would argue there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution was happening.
A second possibility is that we can make a evolution of the natural kind of natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the species, as a species -- distant planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in natural ways.
But there is a third possibility -- it's intriguing and intriguing and frightening.
So I call it the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and picked up for us as individuals in the decision that we have.
Now, how could it happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their descent.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to be on the individual and family level.
Think about that if you could be able to choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in their own body to make genetic settings to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to become more and more possible.
The Genome Genome Project started in 1990, and she's 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost to the middle of 20,000 and a week.
We don't have a lot to be able to actually make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of them.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced modern insulin insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial.
You can imagine something good than the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to become more and more possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of your bodies but if they could change the cells of your <unk>
And if you could change sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give your children a better opportunity for a more healthy life, eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want to be more <unk>
And then that same technology gives up that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases to prevent us with diseases to have a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> about everything if you could go to the next generation.
Why don't you have a <unk> <unk> that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes we want to turn the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100 thousand years ago, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe it was happening within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandkids of their grandchildren, are going to have in front of them.
We're going to use these options in a better society for a better society, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the <unk>
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom needed to make these <unk> <unk>
For good or worse, and before what you might -- these choices are going to be dependent on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you are to 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine making <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about in flight <unk>
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had gone down, and we weren't so far.
You could see in Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would be the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
We put the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and not <unk>
And then we said three words.
The three more words I ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
He was terror. Life was <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get and I don't did, all the fences that I've ever wanted to do and never <unk>
While I was thinking about it forward, I came up with a sentence, that is, <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to show it.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that purpose, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while I <unk> the bridge George Washington -- which was not for a lot -- I thought about, Wow, I'm really sorry.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my errors, I've tried to try to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity it also gives me place to me.
And I am sorry about the time that I <unk> in things that I don't care about.
And I thought about my relationship with my friends, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have no reason to be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is how your mental watch is <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be used in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, I will die no fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, only one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- I don't have a lot of artistic talent --  --  And I scream, <unk> as a tiny.
And for me, that was all the reason of the world.
In that point, I understood those two points, which only matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be so -- but imagine, and how do you start?
What is it that you still hope to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change their relations and negative energy on them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many <unk> projects.
But the most cool I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the world's biggest <unk>
One day he came to his house, after running and said, "Dad, feel <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a complete <unk>
It can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, of course, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and said, "Let's give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be communicating with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> -- it's not that all people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and you have a very good insurance you can't actually actually actually actually do that.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Someone to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way. It will make it run by the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was amazed with his brother and her father in that very long time, "OK, this is the Tony Tony going to talk about -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's a ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser device, you draw on that and record the negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All of the things that <unk> they say, are part of a cycle of life.
They start with sexual organs -- then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things from one side to another we had a couple of things.
One, touch the doors of insurance companies, and we get a machine so that you could get a machine like the Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, that's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email of him, and you say, "I don't know it. This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the corners of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid, and that when they were <unk> they had taken off the squares of the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks later, we went to the center of <unk> my son was part, my dog -- and we created this.
It's called <unk>
These are a pair of low-cost sun that we buy in the <unk> <unk> <unk> some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We took a <unk> camera -- we put it together, we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds a <unk> we published the <unk> code -- the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There are no insurance company that I say we can think of.
There's no hospital that I can say we can.
Any person with paralysis, today has access to drawing and communicating with just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after more of a year of planning, two weeks of <unk> intense sessions from all night, Tony came back to the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking parking lot outside of the hospital.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the <unk>
The funny thing was, we had to accept in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and I would take me out of there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our scream of war.
That's what keeps us in the movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it, and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
He said, Armstrong did something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles -- there will be an exhibit called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible.
None of what there is in this room that was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a time.
Do you do anything from this room.
I am not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> <unk> <unk> I just recognized something and I was able to do it with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want we all to do every day when we find out something that we feel to do. If it's not right now, I mean, if I'm not me, at all.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in a very difficult situations, and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine in <unk>
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days out of this kind of fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end of the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I have been <unk> in a very awful goal with the only goal to try to look at social questions in ways that would be interesting, and, hopefully analyzing them in a way that looked useful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'm going to come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk of 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it does, and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into a ridiculous or your company to do it.
But this is a very good opportunity for <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have been able to be able to be <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing world.
And as I said earlier, I was in horrible situations in the last few years, but I could nothing -- nothing could be <unk> for something as difficult to go into the room with these kinds.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all of the film was happening with <unk> of marketing products.
The movie is going to be called "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever ever <unk> is that everything on top at the end, has images of brand, all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people would be beaten up to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He was <unk>
But we're not only going to have the score of the brand available to the degree, but we're going to make sure that we're going to get all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you're going to run a shoe and become the most cool shoe you've ever heard.
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest car ever ever <unk> the best <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then also going to show the brands as a part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you, help you make it to happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're going to go -- it's very <unk> but you know how to go to <unk> <unk> -- not David <unk> How much money takes to do this?
MS: A million a half and a half a <unk> <unk>   I think it's going to be difficult to the meeting with them but certainly is going to be worth to convince a couple of big numbers.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie came to us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> The vast majority of the answers will be produced.
MS: But it's going to be difficult to <unk> for the film for me.
JK: Both things.
MS:  It means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk>
MK: We have to think of what brand.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside of it.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of you wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I surprised me.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as we can, and so many people would see as possible.
Especially in the world of this intersection of new media and old media intersection and the stage of apart, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention, which is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such one.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you search for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that would show up.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey -- No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, and maybe the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians, the president -- the president -- even the <unk> <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to it -- it actually changes something that changes suddenly it changes it.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that rare bear, it's still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want it to be <unk> history.
We want it to be a story, but you know, <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there he was staring at me, as I used to <unk> it said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only a company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> -- I realized that I would have to go through my mind, I would have to take away the <unk> and go to the same with my team.
So what I started to see suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films that make big films and huge huge, and others who make small movies like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big Hollywood movies say that the reason that their movies have so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk> <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open my <unk> you see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good good for this <unk>
You have <unk> you see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you to help you out."
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have so much for a man like for a solid, solid, to <unk> on pole and whatever.
That's the overall look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Full: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of movies that we have, we are rather a <unk> brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have any other brand.
So do things like this, you know, remind people to be the reason that we're interested in to us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep us more time? They have better <unk> <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who have <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the guy from the street, to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: Do my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, we have <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> brand.
<unk> Something unique.
I like a lot of dark colors -- many gray colors and things like that.
Typically, I carry messages like <unk> or <unk> like <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand a brand <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In some sort of <unk> part of the <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I <unk> the <unk>
Man shall <unk> <unk>
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be done, Tom, but I often sat down at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh <unk>
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk>
If they were able to do it for them, they would surely be able to do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photo.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which they are around you, and your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family, in Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: Next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this matter?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like funny things, I like the rare stuff.
A: Tell the <unk> for what does it mean?
What is <unk>
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What else do you get? You have <unk>
It doesn't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: thank you for your own lady. Great <unk>  Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.)
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of different sides -- but <unk> in your personality personality -- the Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It was very nicely together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just <unk> in one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually get a positive time for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are it?
The first here is classical Apple.
And you can see also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and chemical brands -- those things that have gone and come back, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> brand. What is your <unk>
If somebody asks you to take your brand, your brand, your brand, which would be?
You're a <unk> attribute -- you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more good a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are kind of playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or audacious as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> magical or mystical as a <unk>
Or you're more of the <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated <unk>
Are you <unk> modern, <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the history of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing for film.
So we went to St. Paulo where they have banned advertising to the free air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there are no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are going to be able to go in the schools in the schools in the U.S.
So what I've had the great thing for me is that the projects I had the biggest answer or I had more successful are the ones that I've been willing to do with things directly.
And that's what did these brand.
<unk> to the <unk> took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try and be able to try with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They had success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
From <unk> the movie was released in <unk> and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, and it's not <unk>
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this movie has already begun to win <unk>
And it's not bad for all of the agencies that we talk about him with their customers not being part.
I have always believed that if you take a risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think that when you pull the people out of that you're pulling into the failure.
I think that when you train your employees in aversion is preparing all their company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to progress is we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we have to turn it to the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage that we have to put into a cage here.
<unk> fear. <unk> risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And we ultimately have to house transparency.
Now more than ever some honesty is going to run a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends friends who were <unk> the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED matrix -- the <unk> Foundation -- a check by <unk> to be applied to me for the next year.
The idea behind the worm <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are really real control systems.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they are a completely different technology.
But if we could put an effective cash virus in a laptop that was used by an engineer to set up this gray box -- then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> go back to the gray box -- <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> boxes -- these <unk> systems.
That was called the attention, and we started an experiment in which we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So it was very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a market rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after being able to experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if you find a specific system, and even if the program that's trying to infect it is actually working on that one.
If not, it doesn't do anything.
So I called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we don't know what the <unk>
Could it be, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled it up and <unk> the <unk> code, and we found that I was <unk> in two underwater pumps a small and a large one.
We also saw that they were armed with very volunteers, people that obviously had all the inner information.
We would take all the dots to attack it.
You probably even know how long the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, let me tell me, the burden is very complex.
It's very far above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much at the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to <unk> it with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To come to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white and it's probably located in Iran because that's where most infections have been <unk>
They're not many thousands of targets in that area.
It's basically reduces to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went to them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you certainly can go down, and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slowly and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the engineers, so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to crack the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> is <unk> in that code, it can't be <unk>
I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in each other.
So I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been based on several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> they were saying to one and same goal, but from different <unk>
So the small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're really confident that we've determined what the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some really interesting things that we just saw -- I really <unk>
There's the gray box -- and you see the <unk>
So what this thing does is to <unk> the input values for example, of sensors on the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides a <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
So the idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the middle room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act quickly.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam steam goes away from speed, you have to open escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human line.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can take up.
And I don't have the <unk> and the security system that you can do it.
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is <unk>
It's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden on a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what I <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are spaces with great goals.
We have to face the consequences and better than us to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assumed that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK. Do you really want to listen to this?
Yes. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even higher.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give them <unk> or another thing that will do car chairs and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're nothing different than something that gets in the morning, it gives you a great force -- that also increases your speed, and aid, for example, driving the balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But it's not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we began to talk about the U.S. soldier that, on average, must take over their back a charge of 45 pounds, and it's got to be able to take it even more team.
Obviously this leads to some major complications -- injuries in your back, in 30 of the soldiers.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can spend 90 kilos per many hours.
Its flexible design allows you to put it into <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
So what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then you increase my force and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're smart, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back and go back to the users of chairs about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people in chairs around the world.
As one percent of the overall population.
And this is a really conservative calculation of this.
We talk about something that happens very often very young people with damage.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> fast.
Her only option, many times -- by a brain injury.
And this has been for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using <unk> <unk> who 19 years ago had a spinal cord injury.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has <unk>
It completely <unk> in the crutches they send signals to the board, here on the back.
There's also some batteries that give energy to the motors in <unk> and on the knees and they do it with this soft <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old, at the top of my life when, by a stranger in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a whole sense and all of the movement on the <unk>
Soon long later, a doctor went to my room in the hospital, and she said, <unk> never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole the last amount of hope of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it down in <unk> to climb rocks and even ride by hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but based on and all the users of chairs for everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice to say hello, and the game is the order of the day, where fun is a thing.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know your cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos from the forests of Congo.
<unk> are, along with chimpanzees, their living relatives in the <unk>
That means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary ancestor that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too concerned about this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimps are dominated by large men, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the death is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the jungle and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage for decades and caused almost many deaths like World War II.
It's no wonder that this destruction will also put it in danger to the <unk>
<unk> meat trade and deforestation make you not fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know we know them like the apes -- <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk>
<unk> as humans, loves to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish ties and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity.
And when you look at the Bonobo Bonobo sees the <unk> <unk> same of laughter -- the dance and the humans.
The game is the glue that comes us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos of only the wild.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football it.
Here's a female woman, and a young male in a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case to his case -- right?
Yes.
So the sexual game is common in Africa as a human game.
And this video is really interesting because it would take this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing some unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how the game needs confidence and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to say, <unk> this is a young female female, which is playing with <unk> water.
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inside and outside of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world every more difficult and more difficult and most cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's go to the ultimate our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the less appropriate thing to play, you can be the moments that is the most urgent time.
So primates, to accept this gift of evolution and play together while they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers would provide a highly qualified staff you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a fairly high probability to go.
But still, there was a race to standing against the other volunteers to go to the captain and find out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
And we were at full night, she stood out out of the rain, under a <unk> in her head, while his home was in fire.
The other volunteer. I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> --  -- the first way to the captain and he asked her to fit and save the dog of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money who, for the rest of his life, would have to tell people who went into a building in a <unk> building to save a living alive because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go back to the house.
I need to make it <unk> I need the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of shoes.
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected to do, but I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, country to the fire of the hall, and it was at that height of the time, that at that height of the time they had finished off the fire, and he went into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge back around the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog at the main door at the front doors.
<unk> from the house, the treasures for your owner where, as you would expect, his deforestation, much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> for the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both on my calling at Robin <unk> like in my <unk> as I am, I witnessed acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have done it, or you're going to make some remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you of this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give. It will be now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a park park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have a chance to save the life of somebody -- but each day we're going to influence your life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem weird -- but I'm a great fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete block was built in <unk> with a very simple idea of concrete modules of a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, as buildings or a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He was called a brick of <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> building blocks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or home.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of concrete, the favorite of the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that led us from a <unk> <unk> world we would have some about others to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows us to create a lot more and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a difference. The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't argue that the building blocks of our time are attributed to experts, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, and motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a color code.
The green is the bottom blue -- the <unk> is the input and the orange line is the <unk>
So only you have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly, and very quickly, you can start to do higher circuits in it.
A blue with a green one produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
<unk> this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make them faster or slow, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a collection growing up.
We want all the interactions in the world to move to building blocks ready to use it.
<unk> sound, solar panels -- it must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is, how do you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
So for example, how a light works, or why does it work?
We have also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any electronics are starting to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles, and we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in wood and wood and paper and we said, "Let's do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done a project that have done, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> which has a fear of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and you can download all the design files and you can download all the design files and you can download all the design files and you download all the design files and you download all the design files and you download all the design files and you download all the design files and you download all the design files and
We want to encourage a world of creators inventors and collaborators because this world where we live, this interactive world is us.
So let's go ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company search to engage with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue the next one side to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm going to tell you the time.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in a environment that represents almost everything that we're supposed to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk>
<unk> some members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of getting them to the Third World, we send them to the wildlife <unk>
They made great <unk> worked with <unk> employees worked with <unk>
Her task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a meeting of the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would go to a quote, but what really search is that somebody has caught up when it was caught by the snow because it knows not very good -- turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for the help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were out there in February and at that moment that we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else, that citizens would have <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you go.
When you do so, you put a name, in this case, <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
So it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 apps -- last year.
But it does something that any other technology from the U.S. government.
And it stretches in form.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app realized that I could use it -- not for snow, but for the citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work on these <unk> of tsunami, but people would run the batteries.
So she asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that would use it.
And this has been spread out without <unk> organic and natural <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition of general takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their kids.
Then they told us that they made the normal channels there would have been taken at least two million dollars and spend about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the state of California that even the moment has side billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that was program in a couple of days and it spreads in a viral form of a warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies as a lot of people think it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but rather like the own Internet.
I mean, without constraints, in form open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very big community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with effectively.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> <unk> every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration in that but you don't have <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave aside the feelings of politics, line up in the <unk> <unk> and all those other things that are faced with the government is, essentially, in words of Tim <unk> which we do together because they alone don't understand.
Now, many people have <unk>
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
Now, politics is not <unk> the government.
And because the government will ultimately emerge from -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> -- the way to think about it will affect the way the change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to choose <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of services for services and information.
It's the place that hits the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music hard and see if you go away.
And so it worked. So it worked.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has an app and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
You don't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this happened really, really does this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, freshwater <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical physics.
And it's also a great example of the government income to collaboration distributed <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological platform.
I talk about a platform for people to be <unk> and help others.
So a citizen helped each other, but here the government had a key part.
It connected to the two people.
And it could have connected them with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call control control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think it's one of the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government is <unk> our values and our needs, but we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean, and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
So that's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a long contempt.
But that's that <unk> what keeps us out of that that we funded as something that operates on our against that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we have to make the bureaucracy that is sexy.
Because that's where the real government works.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
<unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed <unk> report in response to the request of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> in front of government, it's time to ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our kids.
You have to look at the huge challenges that they have to face.
They really think that we will get to where we have to go without fixing the institution that can act on the <unk>
We can't have a government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function of government so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act -- only to articulate the systems of the correct way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm a larger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time, and they do it.
So when you face the government problem you don't really care about making your voices.
They're using their hands.
They put their hands into the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away from a trash that has a trash bucket that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always be cleaned up those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers are not only consumers of government that we pay tax and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and in the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED, watching and hearing these stimulus -- has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here have an impact around the world.
Sometimes, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would not have in another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic <unk>
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, if it's <unk> it can achieve a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't have learned this in the practice of the right, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it had power.
It was the last word in every argument in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia on the <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little little bit and I looked at her, she was approaching me and I was going to give me a good ride.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then I was <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, I was going to come back and tell me I know, I was leaving peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to be near it.
The only problem is, I had 10 children.
My mother was the less than 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to take his time and your attention.
My cousins were running all over.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was at the other side of the room and I looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at her and she said, but she was very serious.
After 15 -- 20 minutes, she got up, I went through the room, I took my hand out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. We go to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "Okay, do you <unk>
She said, "Now I don't <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want?
I'll never forget it.
Then she said, "Just want me to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I would go to my mama, I said, "Yes, <unk> I <unk>
And then she said, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you're always going to do the right thing -- even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I was like, "Yeah, I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
And then he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister a lower.
When I was 14 to 15, 15, a day my brother got home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got doing the <unk> of always, all the time.
He took a sip of beer, he gave my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take a <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, you do it -- and you always do the same as we have.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, <unk> I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I sat down with the <unk> and I said, "Oh, not being that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells us all the grandkids that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to say something to you.
I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that the identity.
When we created the correct kind of identity, we say things to others that actually don't see sense.
We can't get to do things that don't think we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandkids were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My whooping died of diseases that were killed with alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is now very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the highest incarceration rate of the world.
So we have seven million people in trouble.
And this mass incarceration in my opinion, has changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities that find so much <unk> so much <unk> by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail, or in trouble.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington -- 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all of the color are in prison, or in trouble.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race -- it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is so much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth which affects the results of results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems for us.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work, some developments a little bit curious.
In my state -- in Alabama, as in other states, you care about rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male has lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of rights will be as high as it was before we had the law of the right vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent kids.
A lot of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they were sentence.
We have in this country prison for kids, without any chance of coming out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
It would give people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense we have been able to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
From every nine people who have been identified one that is innocent and released from the death row.
One rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
It would not be able to fly it to be able to fly airplanes if every nine you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if you deserve to kill.
And it's interesting that in my classes with students about history -- I talk about slavery about slavery ...
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding of the rebuilding and lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was sort of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
I was concerned to be <unk>
The terror threat was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say, you know, Stevenson, -- <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history -- for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
ask me to say, <unk> <unk> that grew up with that."
The era of terrorism was obviously with <unk> and decades of race to race and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've ever done.
All of the time we're going to do with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a engagement with the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany, giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's very worrying about listening to what you want?
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There is no way for our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> we could run the <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we be in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We could not be <unk>
It would be <unk>
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we actually don't really care about these things that are so difficult, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by the technology of <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But <unk> those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
We talked about the need for having more hope, more engagement with the most basic challenges of life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> which will never come to TED.
So if you think about it is, in some ways, something that's within our being.
We really have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational, so engaged with the intellectual thing.
And development is about innovation, and development is not only about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also because of the heart.
So this connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at is not only in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader, talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but primarily what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in <unk> and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically in the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, has <unk>
There's no <unk> to relate to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human beings if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> of injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to know to Rosa <unk>
These women were all together to talk about.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I called me to say, <unk> come up with the <unk>
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Be lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, and what are you going to do when I <unk>
I was <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion I was listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks was conducted to me, and he said, "Now, thank you that's that idea of justice justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the delivery of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom for the <unk>
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> getting very <unk>
At that point, Ms. <unk> <unk> me in the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think actually the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find a way to deal with those challenges, these problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> on things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is higher to the worst we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the world.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't <unk> it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> -- you don't judge our technology, for our design or our intellectual capacity or our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of a society, not by the way they deal with the rich and powerful people, but by the way they deal with the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
I think, sometimes I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes, sometimes I do a lot of force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to go to prison, and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> to be <unk> as adults are.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can an judge turn to someone who doesn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was very late was awake for God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14-year-old customer <unk> a small, poor black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so that my black customer was treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I had been <unk> conduct in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there are no ethical empathy, but a whole lack of ethical effect.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> but he had sent it to the court.
It was about two months, and I had forgotten it.
And then finally, <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the court for this case.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came down from the car. He sat at the court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I am a <unk> he said, "It's you. He said yeah.
So I walked up to me and <unk>
And I <unk> in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected to my inner identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a view of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> and we started to go through.
People started to get them, all were <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came up the cops who are fiscal records -- the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how the room was full of people. All right, because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I was going to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look out of the window and you can hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with the face of concern, walked in the room and sat behind me, almost on the kitchen table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed <unk> because the <unk> had gone into the room.
The <unk> <unk> over the old black <unk>
He said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black stood up and I looked at the <unk> I looked at me and said, <unk> to this <unk> room to tell this young man to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I come here today because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big -- but it folds into justice.
We can't really be truly human beings -- if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is attached to others.
What our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must go to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help you something.
Something is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities near it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> -- this spring in which is going to be an effort to <unk> the funds that are spending now in a punishment of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty over the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases are not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law to get the law, to security.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the greatest <unk> rate.
What would you say to you that you think this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence.
The great growth of mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal sources to bring people to the supply chain, by stealing a bicycle by small crimes against the property, rather than making those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our present philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the guidance that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've excited you've got to do this here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> threats by death bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia.
<unk> 4: <unk>
<unk> Karachi, social, <unk> <unk>

A number of <unk> war to the <unk> political <unk>

<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months. You could be for the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media prefer <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second every day our senses are receiving lots of more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing mattered to us more than -- the first stop all of these data is an ancient chunk of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, early danger.
<unk> and records all of the information for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So from a <unk> of stories that would be looking at the worse.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us a negative news, the seven days of week, 24 hours a day, is not surprising to be <unk>
It doesn't surprise you that the world is going to think that the world will be wrong.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe instead what happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change -- the mass extinction -- the shortage of water and <unk> we certainly have them.
As human beings we are very good for <unk> the problems, and the long run, we just went with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average per capita per capita by inflation has <unk>
Music mortality has reduced 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food for electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are <unk>
And we have <unk> expectations more and higher expectations and <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States -- a lot of people who live under the poverty line, they have electricity, water, <unk> TV, television, cell phones and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, I would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this is the technology -- and we have an exponential.
My good friend Ray showed that whatever a tool that is <unk> in technology technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, how smooth is -- in good and bad time -- in the war and peace -- in recession in the recession in depression and <unk>
It's the result of rapid computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is in fact getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation on the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computation -- sensors and networks -- 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, biological biology, fuel biology, the food and the digital biology, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking at the newspaper the best headline that <unk>
And I loved this one: <unk> <unk> <unk>
So "Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to everyone on your phone.
So four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, there would be <unk>
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking it out of it, and it is <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the kind of left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the end of the myth to Washington is aluminum here.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's attached to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Think about the shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet by <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They go to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about it but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of sunlight fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT came up a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of America, electricity will cost six cents the <unk> per hour compared to 15 cents a national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of energy.
Let's talk about wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the spacecraft Voyager to the Earth, in 1990, as I've spent <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how did it go?
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is two-thirds -- two percent ice is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not 10 -- 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator for a small refrigerator size.
It's able to make a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any source -- salt salt water -- you see a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I'm going to make an important test of these units in the developing world.
If that goes well, and I have full confidence in which it is, Coca-Cola was to implement it in the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get 70 percent penetration of cell phones in the developing world.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has a better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya, that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to say with an intelligent phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that president Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and information that no one could have predicted ever.
You'd better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, images, books.
Maybe the best thing to do is when it comes to the health <unk>
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the X <unk> X <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device that you speak, and because it has <unk> you can get blood out of the finger of the finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world that there are no doctors, where the <unk> charge is from 25 percent -- and there are <unk> health workers.
When this device was <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't have to be able to call the health system and, first of all, avoid that the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of it.
I call it a billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just spent the brand for seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected to it.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you want? What do you want?
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And it was more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy with the Khan Academy and because of the use of printing in 3D and the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about some voices never before.
How about if we give them to the conflicts, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and to be able to act for the first time?
What do you find?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
Something I learned with the X X is that small, guided by their passion with a goal of course, can do things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really <unk>
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of them.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington University, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure of structure and work.
It's a very important thing in the research research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They played with this college teachers in college teachers.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and began to <unk>
And it has been shown today that the pattern of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponentially.
We have the passion of <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that we have to work on to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I'm going to give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they think that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
In fact, <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it too much to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so it doesn't have anything special.
But the case is, we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say that they follow <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another projection the change of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a parasite in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't from there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from <unk>
He had <unk> from about 20 seconds, the <unk> of black.
And the fish fishery was very abundant and it was happening for a good time, so he was made more of the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had gone down to half.
<unk> to the five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In some ways, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change -- but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was imposing the countries that were already 100 <unk> <unk> the industrial revenue.
And this boat, pretty ugly -- it's called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish on him, and we did studies in the South Sea Sea, and above all, in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
90 percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of some of the fish -- tiny things that are coral coral <unk>
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because transition is very rapidly.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the mall.
The bottom of being a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
I don't have the <unk> because they were dead.
One time we captured a living life.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of debris is what the fishermen are getting every time you go to an area where they have never fish.
But it doesn't have <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
So the beginning of the start to the new level, not remember what was there.
If you look at this something like that.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and transition forward.
The difference is that they feel the loss.
But they don't feel the loss that happened before.
You can measure the <unk> of changes.
And at the end of a few <unk> <unk>
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer are, or they're not what they did.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies -- they kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very hungry.
You don't lose <unk>
You lose a little bit common.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in an ocean synonymous with great fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they're going to do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not in the way that they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain such as and just looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used -- or usually don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources.
From there the huge role that can fulfill a protected area.
Because with marine protected zones we actually bring the past.
<unk> the past people can't think because the starting point has been running and it's incredibly low.
That's for the people who can see a protected field protected area and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people of the West -- for example?
I think there are the arts and movie maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you might have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people come up with the movie <unk> talk about the history of <unk> why <unk> <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is to Cameron -- <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are making viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger -- that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper is in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
It goes up over 48 hours to YouTube for a minute.
And, of those, just a small percentage of all, gets countless of them, and you make a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and community factor.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow, one?
<unk> <unk>
KA: The last year, <unk> <unk> published this video out of his home in the National Park.
In 2010, I saw 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the growth of 90 percent of the last summer.
<unk> was not saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this guy who would take the video to the popular.
<unk> like Jimmy <unk> we show us new things and interesting and <unk> to a larger audience.
Video: <unk>  It's Friday, square -- you have to start on the Discovery   You all want to get a week, the weekend of week, the weekend --            I wouldn't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of mutations -- it's one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to come out of anything.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you're asked by those other <unk> they are also playing.
But what happened this day, this <unk> <unk>
Well, I took it out, and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a creators group will take a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great inner joke that starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there were a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare to know that there's a three million hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the <unk> community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Someone made a version of the old one.
And then it became local.
Suddenly, I came up a whole community of <unk> that made this to be a silly joke to something that we can all be a part.
Because it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like that?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or dangerously Black or <unk>
How do you have been written by written that <unk>
In a world where two days go up two days of video for a minute, just that truly unexpected and unexpected can be done by the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really look too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you in circular with the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> made five million saw and understanding his idea.
So this approach is worth all the new thing we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities of participation, totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media, which is a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the success.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all kind of the owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're barely the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose whole life had been supported in the only unit of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> go into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in the societies.
So the words for so long, friends, now it was <unk>
It <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather's <unk>
I never met.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother could never let me forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was to learn that the history tried to <unk> but I <unk> it.
So the next part of the puzzle is about a boat at all?
My mother, <unk> I was only 18, when her father died, and a <unk> marriage, and two small girls.
For her, life was meant to <unk> the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And then from a four years that challenges the fiction -- a boat would appear to the <unk> sea of <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of the <unk> the rape and death.
As most adults, my mother had a <unk> with <unk>
So if we were going to go out, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the platform oil in front of <unk> and the young man who collapsed and she ended up the journey was too much for her, and the first apple that I did, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations to make a new life form together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is actually composed of explanation.
Unlike the middle suburbs of middle class whose existence would be <unk> in <unk> there were no sense of the right.
<unk> that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> between the people who had one thing in common.
My mother worked in farms, then in a assembly line of cars, and working six days twice a look.
Even so, I found time to study English and get a degree on <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
Every one of the dollars were <unk> and they set up an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it would no matter what it should be <unk> which was usually <unk> <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And he had <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home.
Something <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and <unk> the motions of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to <unk>
She opened a computers, and then I studied to be <unk> and she opened another business.
And women would come up with their stories about men who couldn't do the Olympics and angry and <unk> and boys were caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> <unk> student with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in the lives of <unk> increasingly, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many got helps through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of a while, I chose the young Australian Australian year.
And I was a piece of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges doesn't <unk>
So I had a <unk> resident from <unk> it was now as <unk> refugee and social, invited to talk about sites that had never heard of, and in houses that I had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the <unk> and the happy of life in a <unk> <unk> a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end up the day as they did for almost 20 years ago -- <unk> on the day of every single bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when we go to the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> she said, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more I was talking about it, more of all, to talk about it.
I met people from all the paths of life, so many of them doing what we were living on living on the edge of the same possible.
And even though I finished my <unk> I realized I could not be in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown -- a <unk> <unk> new on the scene -- and not only it's okay, but it's something to be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside may easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps outside my happy place to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear about.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a optimism optimism -- a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So I continued my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for the people who the motto cannot be <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year, we had no <unk>
At the end of every day, I had a giant degree of soup, that all of the <unk>
It was going to be able to get it down to the night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some brilliant, and we open up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the <unk> adventure.
After the end of it, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norms and the local <unk> was the person that matter.
Life had no change for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
My mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused a <unk> to <unk> and take the cause she himself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
The can't be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower at the room of a hotel in <unk> when she died, to <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"I have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who are and how life came together, we can see that the men that have come to our lives have <unk>
<unk> would have <unk> easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could want it to look like this.
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, <unk> brave on each wave, the constant rate of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see it safe and you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here in the fourth or fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the American <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and break the sky.
We now do it.
At that time, when I was the great prince warrior warrior knew -- I had <unk> I had <unk> I had <unk> and I had <unk> and I had <unk>
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The bottom line was that the machinery had replaced with magic.
And that was <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more of <unk>
So I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
I thought that technology had to allow the magic to be <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had a sense that your phone, the luxury shift, and the cameras prevent that <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came to this technology world to see how it would use it to create magic instead of <unk>
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a piece of storytelling that will connect the readers of the whole world.
Can you know how we take the book.
Where we are, where we are.
We set up the text with the image, the animation, and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that mean?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character of the book.
In a number of moments I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl are excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that <unk> children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned to me.
So over here, we have to scale up the iPad to release firefly
And, of truth, you turn your way into the way you share with the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with was that a whole galaxy was <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of fantasy book has been maps but have been static.
This is a map that will grow, <unk> and you guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another important aspect for me is creating Indian content, and the contemporary thing.
These are the <unk>
We have all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India knows their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras over Indra for millennia, in an old book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history.
In a history that is about current issues like environmental crisis.
And, and talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> then they become the <unk> they haven't gone to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out outside of the outside and take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, children don't do that.
So to get this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter -- <unk> a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another one, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this creates a collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between magic -- Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality of animated <unk> that appear on the inside of the house.
So at a moment the screen is full of leaves full of leaves the screen.
And you have to make the sound of wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are going to be <unk> with technology and magic and technology to come up with one another.
You know, the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves the same natural world, and that magic joy and child love that we sit through with a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of cafe or tea and asked patients and family and <unk> What do you want?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone is, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects, we have to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It's got a little bit of a place and closed up.
All the morning I got to me.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor's doctor, he has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when it needs <unk> or any urgency of that style -- but see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you -- you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect me to my Wi-Fi scale and before I went up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs that were used to help patients be used to help patients be used for obesity, and also so that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
On the next week, it's available to be available for the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to go from their homes, take their blood pressure, they would take their blood pressure, they would take their doctor, and you would share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position -- they go back to the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it also can help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the shot of the costs of attention -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to get the patients into the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we had to share with you with you with a video with you.
We all have navigation navigation in the <unk>
Maybe we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM ATM <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was to do <unk> in the Netherlands, <unk>
We created a web site, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for favor <unk> where, when it's open, because when it's open, because when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were presented in the Netherlands, <unk>
The next step was looking for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else, they can use your iPhone, and to use their next to use your Microsoft <unk> to find the closest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this -- not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to call it globally.
We are <unk> to all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're standing on holiday and someone <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I would also want to invite companies around the world that could help us attack these <unk>
You might be a voting services or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that is still in their place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest for photography came up with my first digital camera at age 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion by drawing but it was a little bit different because in using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started to push the <unk>
<unk> like a building on a very <unk> <unk>
But it has a twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a level of mind.
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say that?" I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what's the trick that makes it seem true.
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk>
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end this is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
And I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality from reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three things that are perfectly <unk> which we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if you had to go in there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process when I combine the photographs.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those people who don't even understand the things around our everyday life.
But when we combine photographs that is very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I'd like to say there are three simple rules that are going to go to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images do with these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
And I think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, I even made a red red house at the top of the island to be more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic result, I think it needs to be planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that you can be very beautiful and a very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that took from a folder of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details, but the general shape.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this is like a lot of other people that we tend to see, it's a kind of straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves -- it's something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technology on <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them into a regular curve in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram would look like this.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you go back, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve -- it would be very bad, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a <unk> shift.
If the technology of the transportation of transportation is as fast as the <unk> last morning, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that pace.
There's no unprecedented in the history of the technology of a technological growth that every few years ago of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- if you look at these <unk> curves we see that they're not going forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or, well, it's going to turn into a typical curve. I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
And so we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way that you have the world?
Where new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still in 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, across my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that I <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit of things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time that I'd like to do is the time of life on the Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back over a couple million years when the Earth was a great agricultural rock with many chemicals that would be <unk> around them.
If you look at the way that those chemicals are organized -- we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. So I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and it is that, at that time, there were a little bit of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemicals in its inside.
Some of those oil drops had been a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring the materials out of the outer and the drops grew grew in grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell shapes -- those <unk>
But those drops weren't alive -- in the current sense, because each of them contained a random random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you have a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that somehow they were better at the time of adding the chemicals -- <unk> more chemicals -- and they have more chemicals -- and they get more.
Mostly living lived longer were <unk>
It was a form of life, life, very simple, but things got interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some form that we don't understand very well these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemist called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to register what were to be able to register with the <unk>
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to be stable since it evolved two million years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, each being living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> and we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that try to hide to the security of the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the ordinary letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would be 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If you were a <unk> it would have put it in a virus and it would have spread across the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy.
But then it happened another interesting step in which things are going to be very different -- and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form the cells.
I don't know if you know it, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
And so, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to communities that in a way, they were together in that way, and a <unk>
From that way, <unk> or <unk> and whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community are <unk> more and <unk> for evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe of the community in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life led to another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have many cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart of the heart, or the muscle, or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and made more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that did not make more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these mobile cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> in the community being the structures responsible for <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was sort of confined to the length of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because I knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen for the life of a organism that had built these processing structures of information that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals that ate that fruit that ate that fruit of individuals that ate that fruit that ate that fruit of individuals that ate that fruit of it.
And so the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information that has dramatically changed the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now be confined to a individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention of it.
I have a very complicated idea, and I have a very complicated idea.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and, hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your head that saved some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated -- we turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
We now move through similar periods to <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and the information processing stuff.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the video tape -- the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at all.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> which produced some evolution with the <unk> program in our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of history that would tell you a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain took a few hundred million years.
<unk> language, and so on.
And again, like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that takes a pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent advances of recent advances in the time.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible to myself, in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions of millions.
Instead of that, with <unk> designers -- we think a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and the machine with that does something that does not be could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand right.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
So we put it into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of them.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions to <unk>
You could run these sound sequences at chance, run all those programs -- and to take those who are more attached to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to just order to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, fortunately, it could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> to the rest of it.
And now I'm going to tell you the best <unk> numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analogous to the <unk>
Let's take two programs that <unk> kids, that <unk> <unk> and the kids would have the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
It would go back again.
<unk> some mutations ...
And it tries again and tries to go back with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or complex cases, in a few hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that set numbers to be absolutely perfect.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to prove it, to see how they work.
These are dark innovation.
But the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of security -- because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of shows that they made it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on that.
One time I was going to go in a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and you take a card and you say, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> it has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight. It doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes do not work very well when they're getting complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make processes of design <unk>
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than it produces normal education.
However, we don't understand the whole thing that you have.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
We now use those programs to do much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part of thinking that we are the end of evolution.
And I think we're all part of the creation of whatever it goes.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up some of my fake <unk>
Before the theme of my talk, we talk about a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end of the <unk> World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to go out of <unk> the <unk> talk about the statistics, and we used them to form a huge baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you have heard of them.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talk about 300 of a <unk> that we would say, 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who is trying to stick to the first base, not reach time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> <unk>
Well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how you call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who has 10 <unk> it gets four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are, you know, a surgeon who has a <unk> record in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now assume that they live in a sudden place and a wanting to have two <unk> <unk> <unk> and your family doctor comes to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better.
And his hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask them.
What do you think must be the average of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I would be included in the world of being perfect.
You could ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was an eternal <unk>
One time, a fellow in the high school said that Brian Goldman Sachs went to a blood test for a blood test.
It's like this.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the New York Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent differential diagnosis and the <unk>
And I even knew the logical diagnosis of how they classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was going to go very well. I graduated with <unk>
And I think about the school of medicine with the impression that if you have everything, then they would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency service of the emergency room where I worked.
I was assigned to the <unk> <unk>
And when I was an emergency applied to a cardiologist and I was going to go to that patient.
and to report the chief of dying.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both places, which has a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stop going and, rather than pump your blood forward, your blood goes to your lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't difficult to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I <unk>
I gave them <unk> and medications to relieve the pressure on his heart.
I gave them <unk> water pills -- so that it could eliminate liquid it.
And in an hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
In fact, I made two more mistakes more.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of dying.
I didn't take the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to contribute <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would be a <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact with my own.
The second mistake I made was worse.
By the end of his house, I didn't take care of a voice in my inner voice that said, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that I would go to the <unk> <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, <unk> <unk> I think it's going to be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was the high, and the ambulance along with the <unk> her home.
And I went back to the room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a <unk> in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the stomach, in the
I continued to follow my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was my car to go home, and I did something that I don't do normally, I don't do that.
It happened to the emergency service service to home.
And there was another nurse, not the one that <unk> from the lunch lady -- but another one, told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency physicians of emergency.
Other specialists fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the <unk> patients.
So three words are: it remembers you?
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
He asked the other nurse, with total <unk>
So she said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of having come to his house, after I gave up the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> and the ambulance was brought to emergency with <unk> blood pressure.
I was just breathing and she was blue.
The emergency staff, all of their resources.
They gave them medication to raise the blood pressure.
And they had a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I hope against all of hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days next was clear that I never <unk>
He had a brain damage.
The family came together.
And eight or nine or nine days ago, it was going to be going on.
And the ninth day, she left her go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the week, I was amazed by that and I experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, isolated without feeling a healthy shame because you can't afford them with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad at all.
It's that it tells us not that what we did was, but we are bad guys.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I <unk> the things and I made sure I don't have to tell me.
And I continued to get those questions.
Why didn't I asked my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> why did I make a mistake <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
slowly that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, he opened the sky and eventually the sun. I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me that if I was going to go to the efforts to be perfect to make more errors, I would make fun of those voices.
And it was.
I came back to work, and I came back to work, I came back.
But it came back again.
Two years later, I was launched in the emergency room in a community hospital in north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
She would take him penicillin and sent him home.
But while he was headed at the door, I kept pointing to his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> change my head to talk to me in his office.
And I spoke three words: it remembers you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and had a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not for the reason it's about the top, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He did not die.
It was <unk> antibiotics -- and they recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, particularly working in a hospital, because it was going to be 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
He turned an X-ray of kidneys but it turns out, a colleague that was checking on the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom right and called the surgeon.
The other patient was very much diarrhea.
So liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague that I <unk>
I checked it and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom right corner, I called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and no support.
And here's the problem: if I can't go back, and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what is, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I wouldn't have the idea of what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, behind failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll be able to talk about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital would be the wrong leg leg -- it would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> that make errors and the ones that can't sleep and the ones that I know you can't sleep and the ones that have a great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that are starting to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take away from medicine to people who make errors, we will be a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical doctor and medical errors, to learn how we can, from the first paper that I wrote for Star Trek until my <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We worked on a system where errors are happening every day, where one of every 10 drugs in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system that infection will be more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, dying 24 <unk> for medical <unk>
The U.S. Institute set <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system, where knowledge is spread every two or three years ago, and we don't have <unk>
<unk> dream is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in your chest, come up with <unk> eyes, and I encourage alcohol and, all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get to us, and we eliminate all the professionals of mistake, well, not to be anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> art -- it's already a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would argue to everybody, since the chief of surgery to the chief of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
And their students were <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical <unk>
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, and they accept it, and it's not proud of their errors, but you try to learn from how to teach it to teach others.
They had their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and of support for all of them <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes rather than time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, and I'm a mistake, <unk>
And I feel a lot, but I'm going to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to choose a half a half a day.
It doesn't make a lot of a long ago, in a research followed by a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> and the time that we have to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> work for a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think of your election.
Do you know how many you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you define the way that you deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choose to choose the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and of some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to give you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, you just raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this level of very, very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of them, and this was when you take water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion I asked myself, why don't I buy nothing?
This is the <unk> <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
One time I decided to go to the manager and said, <unk> this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed me the buses full of tourist coming every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to make a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different class.
<unk> a put to <unk> right at the entrance to the shop.
We put there in six <unk> or about 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60, that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From the ones that I stopped when there was only three percent to buy <unk>
From those of you who stood when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably have a little bit less -- it's good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of options are affecting us in good <unk>
We decided not to decide, even when this doesn't make us <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the savings choices, for the retirement of a million Americans, in between a million Americans, of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money <unk> available in savings plans, the <unk> program will be able to save people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were going from two to 59 different options.
And we found that the bigger age of funds had less participation.
So if we look at the extreme people, we see that in the plans that offer two, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 dollars, the rate of participation went down to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there's a negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choices, more people to avoid action or investment capital.
In the way there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial <unk>
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to optimize the well-being of the future.
In the previous decade we've seen three key negative consequences to offer more of them and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, that the <unk> even when this is against your own interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, and in health.
They are more prone to picking things less <unk> even though objectively it going to be better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that whole variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to try and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've <unk> in one form or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You heard it before, but it has never been more than today, which is less than today, which is less than today.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
worry about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing every time is that if you choose to cut, get rid of strange choices, there will be an increase in sales, we will have a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, you saw an increase of 10 percent in sales space.
When the Golden Golden <unk> I eliminated the products for us to move away from cats.
You know that today's supermarkets, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store they offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce,
In the financial capital, I think that one of the best examples that have come out of how to handle better choices, is the image of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the Harvard from Harvard are <unk> automatically at a fund of life.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the difference that there are between those choices.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people of this audience on a holiday with all of paid for the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time it was real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of choices, which is <unk>
For people understand differences between choices, have to understand the consequences of every option, and the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete
Why reason people spend 15 to 30 to 30 more than the credit card or credit card that when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it looks more real, it can be a very positive tool so that people are getting more.
We made a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting that <unk> exactly as a <unk> we had a little <unk>
So what we added was that I would take a staff to the staff that would think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that were interested in saving or what they wanted to place on their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories that we choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
And we saw that at the supermarket psychopaths throughout the <unk> <unk> display can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because Christmas tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the left of the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the left of the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The left of the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> but you know what?
This scheme is totally useless.
<unk> need to tell something to the <unk> not that the <unk>
It's often seen this problem with those huge <unk> <unk>
"I want who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you only have a little bit.
We have to augment complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows <unk> <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. It's 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is vary the order that the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 color, to a few four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go for a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, so many choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you go through it, always the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many options to young people, <unk> the <unk> button over and over again.
<unk>
If you go from a few options to lots and you keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
So the only thing I did was disrupt the order that the information happened.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
But the picking of changes is not saying anything about the preferences of interior interior -- all of us being made to choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can handle <unk> -- we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help handle the <unk> or better, for you to use them in their business, or for people to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of an election is to be careful to the <unk>
And the closer we can be in our better choices, we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in East Germany, if you had a writing machine must be <unk> in the government.
I had to register a text of text written with the machine.
And so that government could track the origin of the texts.
If you were a written written by the wrong message that could be track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't conceive that someone could do this, how much that would be the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and you print a page, that page is going to end up having a little yellow printed on each page that you follow a pattern that makes it one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be <unk> so much for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put up the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The mobile phone phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use puberty, to make a lot money, a huge numbers.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and so on, etc., etc.
These guys make their <unk> but they do it by illegal media, by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or our keys to get information from our cards to get information from our cards to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen <unk>
Mr. <unk> is <unk>
And I say this is more likely that any of us is a victim of a <unk> that of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most of the <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> <unk> in importance is not motivated by the money.
There's another thing that moves, you motivate them the frogs -- you motivate them the <unk> you motivate them.
So groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months that have been in the last 12 months in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals that make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States that the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
<unk> the security of the site, and a <unk>
I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yeah.
So how do people die.
<unk> is <unk> authority, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
So what do the <unk>
Well, you need to have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that I would have a foreign authority, foreign authority.
And they were turning them into <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt -- the headquarters for the <unk> police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
And I had this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to <unk> the communication of the citizens of the country.
He had sold this tool for 1,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials, to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today is beyond.
<unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to enable them to see all media, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think about a lot of things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but I actually don't really affect me, because I'm an honest one.
Why do you start?
I don't have anything to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's the privacy.
privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
And if we could rely on our governments today in 2011, whatever right that we have today, will be forever.
We were blindly <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
Here's where I live, I live in Kenya, in the southern <unk> of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the background, and behind the Senate, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have downstream in the most part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only sentence that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of the lions.
They were dying of these people who protect our community to protect our community and cattle, and they are also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, for six to nine years, is responsible for won his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that to the lions were fear.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because I was even helping lions to see the <unk>
I don't have <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to <unk> lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, came back and said, this thing is not moves, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed it.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that could turn off and off the lights.
And this is a little bit of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell, the battery load the battery and the battery -- the electricity to the little box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the <unk> lights.
As you can see, the <unk> give up, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see this lions when they come from night.
The <unk> lights and <unk> to lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago and since, we never went back to having a problem with the lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yeah.
<unk> you can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've been installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to frightening other predators like Glenn <unk> and it's also using the elephants of farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funds and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I show them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see planes fly, and he told me that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become an engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electric circles.
What is the next thing in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention -- I want to do a close to <unk> CA: A near <unk>
<unk> I know that we were actually invented by chemical fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So you know, a time -- again, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stood up because I got a <unk>  CA: At the bottom of the tactic Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to go to <unk> every single step that <unk> mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we came up all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned much of the rest of the world, except America, South Korea are the enemies.
I sometimes asked me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it was all changed away.
When I was seven, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself were never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When you do this -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two past weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we are prepared to die."
I was very insecure.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A life woman who was still dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were really concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine led to North Korea to North <unk>
At the end of a million North America died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and insects and tree.
They also made more frequent <unk> and more frequent <unk> all around me, was completely black.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a photo satellite photo of North Korea at night.
This is the <unk> River, which serves the limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Africa to go through <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, and sometimes I saw bodies floating on the river, and sometimes I saw bodies floating on.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the years of famine was sent to China to live with <unk>
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family's family.
I had no idea what life would be like.
But I suddenly learned that it's not only hard, but also dangerous, because refugee refugees were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a very awful lot back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Someone had been accused by being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to go up.
If you didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said questions.
At the end of the <unk> a mate said to another one, and she's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America search for <unk> <unk>
But many can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after a hard pressure of international pressure.
These North America did not have so much lucky.
Every year, countless North America are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
I was lucky to be able to break away many other North America, have not had so much lucky.
It's tragic that North America, have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all his world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk South Korea to South Korea at the time.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn how to learn my third language.
I understood that there was a huge gap between North and South <unk>
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even went through a identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call for mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea, it was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the test for college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had some money that sent my family, and, as blame my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the way out of <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to escape.
The North America have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea and South Korea, and South Korea, in South Korea, and South Korea, in South Korea, and South Korea, in the South Korea.
So, ironically, took an flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it in some ways, for over three thousand miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and most of us were trapped many times.
One time, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a officer.
He asked the <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family could not understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese official came to my family, I stood up and I said they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the <unk> <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the <unk> guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the <unk> <unk>
After paying <unk> and my heartbeat was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the <unk>
This was one of the lower dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison, to cut away from the <unk>
And I was going to go between the office office and the police station and desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost the hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would like to ask.
With my poor English, and with a dictionary, I told her the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and I gave me the rest of money for my family and for another two North America, and to take them out of prison.
I was going to go through my heart, and I asked her, "Why are I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the <unk> people.
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The nice unknown -- a new hope for me and for the people to be able to do it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs it.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, and I met in South Korea, and I met in South Korea.
But to achieve their freedom is only half of the battle.
A lot of North America are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, in the English language.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I have been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America, an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North America around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Center.
This is Center for <unk> stores, fast food, fast terrain.
So the city planners got together, and we thought, we're going to change the name of South Center so that it represents something else, so it changed something else, so they changed the South self, as if this was actually bad in the city.
This is Los Angeles --   <unk> <unk> food, fast terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is, the food places to take more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the Los Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times older than say, Beverly <unk> that's like 15 miles away.
I was pleased to see that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food and if every time you go out of your house, you see the <unk> effects that the food system has in your <unk>
I saw <unk> wheels and sold as <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and around to buy an apple that has no pesticide
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> <unk> we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters away.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility, and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided it happened.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we got together, and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine complete vegetables go.
What we do, we are a kind of paid group that made a lot of <unk> of all the <unk> of all the city and completely voluntary and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, he was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city got me above and in summary -- they gave me a <unk> saying I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on.
An order to plant food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, you know, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had the written story by Steve <unk> and I spoke to the <unk> and one of the members of the Green members who had a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> -- we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the American city.
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That equals 20 Central <unk>
That's a space enough to plant millions of plants.
Why the hell don't you think about this?
<unk> a plant will take a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of the result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy of South Center.
I grew up to my children there.
I'm going to be a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow up my art.
It's like a <unk> artist who would go through walls, I <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
And you have to see what the earth can do, if you leave your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a <unk> tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
So you have to see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act, especially in a <unk>
Moreover, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, and they look very <unk>
I, like, man, I felt bad -- and I said, you know, you don't have to do this way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was so close to me with hungry, and I just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people are going to steal your <unk>
So I said, "Oh my God no, I don't have afraid that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant her mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this was so only for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
And we've had a couple of 50 people who are from, working and <unk> every single plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you farm <unk> you will eat <unk>  But if none of these are <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and your body eat blind -- what you put in front of you in front of it.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they are stuck. I see the color that are in this path that is designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are rid of their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we're never going to do it.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't have <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because that's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to get people to get people out of the street, get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening up the farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you wouldn't call me if you want to sit in a comfortable chairs and get meetings to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Man: Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice <unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material for drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains so much.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we have.
And especially if you're going on in your bicycle and these cars -- that's not very nice.
Moreover, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make highways of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the highways of the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the rain water flow over the side and you will have a road per side and you have a road and you have no longer water.
The noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very smooth all the noise -- so it's a very silent road, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you see that in this road the stones of the surface of the surface.
So first a stone, then several more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more, and you know, well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see what the damage appears in this material.
This is a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light to <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue, the glue between the <unk> they will be <unk> and you will get rid of the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel, <unk> of that for clean <unk> and we can cut the steel fleece in very small, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel <unk>
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, particularly steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is blow up the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and stones and stones go back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that goes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we came up with a piece of road, 400 feet of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a bowl of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did -- you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this road last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made aging and we put a lot of charge in them, the reality of our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to test them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using fruit fibers bringing these fibers using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, you can actually double the life of the road, it really will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, it has to cool me first before I can show you how it acts in it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's look. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember I would have got a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray.
He had a great smile on his face that was unlikely at the time, because the news usually <unk>
"The Taliban got my father.
I didn't know what it was, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and they made the <unk> that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be done, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could do the two <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could be surprised where we would be.
We had to hide the books in market bags to look like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stopped in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk>
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every when the school was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about them.
They were <unk>
Do you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so her father was <unk>
But my emergency mother became a teacher.
This is it.
He took two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women of our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, it was the first of all his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a better risk in not educate her kids.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated for our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to say, but my father said, <unk> daughter can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can break your home during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So you still want to be <unk>
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the day, and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I found myself here proud to graduate school.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> of his home for the bravery of educate her daughters, it was one of the first <unk>
He did not only get rid of my college degree, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it on on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global character of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It is why I <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see students in my school with the hard desire to take the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though it was in front of a <unk> opposition to the <unk>
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you your face, but I can't show you your face, but they have been the father of one of my students.
less than a month, he and his daughter would go from <unk> to his village, and literally stopped being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if I was following his daughter to school, I would go back to try.
<unk> now, if you will, he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk>
What I've ever realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people -- there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and you see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> most compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And so that these changes didn't last lot, after retirement U.S. troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of the <unk> I got it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
You never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> against it.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
It's almost two years since the civil revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens would go into and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young young men were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, they are brought apart of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown an bravery to face the <unk> dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of human beings from the Middle East, to the west to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and some losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the challenges, and the challenges, I have dear to many other women, reconstruct civil society, <unk> a physical transition and right towards democracy, and the national reconciliation to democracy.
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started to organize workshops about the development of capabilities, and of leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of women -- <unk> by <unk> a movement of women -- leaders, <unk> <unk> to advocate for the food autonomy of democracy and for our right to <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> that was <unk> of the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was made and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the early elections.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a everything, they were <unk> every day of the news of violence.
One day we wake up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news.
One day we wake up with the news of the financial officers of the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of <unk> and their human rights abuse of human rights and lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made up by a revolutionary mindset, it would become more, and it has gone away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, which we had at the beginning.
You know, diabetes -- and what they became the score of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all of us in all of our history of success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
So I'm just here today to tell us that we as a nation, we choose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't have brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with protective policies of domination and <unk> both by men as women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the elections, and the <unk> and the <unk>
Our nation needs the American representation of women to need to need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as a construction agents and to call it a day of anger.
We need to start to act as compassion agents and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but also put it into the mercy in the place of <unk> collaboration in a place of competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, needs desperately to get the end of peace.
Because peace has a <unk> that comes from the <unk> and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the women and <unk> which goes to all of the humanity that men and women have <unk>
And so just like the <unk> covers the whole <unk> that grows inside, the right matrix of compassion is sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of <unk>
So you say, "My mercy is going to go all the things."
So you say, "My mercy is <unk> on my <unk>
What are you going to be told to all of them, the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a logical question, which has an answer that has a dangerous answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that they all make a good thing for why she looks at it?
Why would someone go to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, and a social, no an expert in domestic violence.
I'm only a woman with a story to tell you.
He was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Stanford University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first green American <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret for me.
My secret was that lots and lots of times, the man, that I create my soul <unk> I would take me to the head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
So I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a nice, psychological trap of love, where they fall every year, and even some men.
Until it could be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> English at Harvard University, and I have a <unk> in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the races, all of the religions -- all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that you all think of domestic violence, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only happening in <unk> and <unk> or <unk> or said otherwise in the families, the last place where we would want or hope to be able to find <unk> which is why politics domestic turns out.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be with a man who does, and I actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women of between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and more than 500 women are killed every year for partners, <unk> and husbands are killed every year for partners, <unk> and husbands are killed every year for partners, <unk>
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence, their warning signals.
I met <unk> in a cold, empty day of January.
I was sitting next to my side of New York City and she started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had just <unk> from a college <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that looked like a <unk>
He had a few great <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it about everything at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
So we started coming out and loved all of me that was list, that I had gone to Harvard, that I had a passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> creates in me, as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to make sacrifices for your partner, so I had my work, I left my job, and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was moving into a <unk> and physical <unk> financial and psychological psychological
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it does.
And this is where you go into these <unk>
In the way we moved to New England -- you know, that place where you are supposed to be so safe to be bought by three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept it under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said, I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived from tiny.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and I had never lifted my hand, my life was really serious danger, every minute every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises had disappeared, I put my girlfriend from my mother and I married it.
Despite what had happened, I was confident that we lived happy forever, because I loved and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of a family with me.
He had been an isolated accident, and I would never make me damage.
I spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I had a few times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple days later, driving back from our moon of honey, he would be <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac Mac to the face.
<unk> followed one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some time of his life, and the Center for disease disease reports that every year 15 million children are <unk>
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to deal with the <unk>
The other question that everyone does is, why don't you just be <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question, because we have the victims, because we have victims, we know something that you don't mean is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 of the murders of domestic violence, they occur after the victim of the end of the <unk> after <unk> because then the <unk> doesn't have anything to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> financial resources, and manipulation of the family family system for <unk> to the victim, and their kids, which are normally required by the judges to spend time with the man who would give up their mother.
And yet, we still ask why it's not going?
I was able to go to -- I was able to go from a last <unk> beating my denial.
I realized that the man I loved and would have killed it if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world, to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, full unknown, and I'm here today because you all have me.
We have the trend to <unk> to victims as the victims of <unk> women -- <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is <unk> by <unk> as if the victims of the victims of the men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who have also learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them, and they <unk> their life lives and happy like <unk> wives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I went back to marry a cute man and nice man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have never more, and it's a charged <unk> pointing to my head in the hands of somebody who says that I want.
At this point, the same thing are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> how stupid -- but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were <unk> they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, to his sister, to his best friend, right now.
I was able to end my crazy love love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request towards you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence, simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need to all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> to the light talking about it with their kids, their friends and family friends.
<unk> his view of survivors as amazing people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the inner signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims safe output to it.
And together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be accurate for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed up like this.  Fortunately, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothes on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of luck to <unk> I think.
And if some of the women are going to be <unk> when you go back, they don't have to go away and find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in so only 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
These geeks are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to go through this sweater, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so I don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this photo, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
He was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I <unk> the back and the baby hair.
Of course, safe with surgery or an artificial surgery like the one I did two days for work, there's very little we can do to transform our looks, which, even though surface and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always does, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry -- which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some lovers in the fashion that <unk> <unk> -- that's -- Joan <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First, the <unk> for knowing as much of models. It's surprising.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- that is less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is, it can be model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then what I would really would say to each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States -- or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> and a poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list of this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no. I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the U.S. magazine or the American CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say you want to be model to be model to say you want to win the lottery when you be higher.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choice.
I'm going to show you everything that I learned in 10 years as a model -- because unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have seen your studies, and you have a goal and a little bit of work to your back, no matter what you might -- that you want to be president of the United States, but you know, you want to be president of inner clothes for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people always make me is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it was practically <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
So this was the first picture I got to myself, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal land, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> <unk> a few days before the pictures for French.
Here's my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not myself in those photos.
<unk> from a group of <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for for us to do things.
I have too many minutes of 20 inches and I never use, except the couple before, but the privilege I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was going to travel with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped in a red light -- and of course, we had a sorry, agent for being able to go to <unk>
<unk> of these <unk> for me, not for what I am. and there are people who are paying a price for your aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and the last year of the teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young black and Latino young guys in New York, so for what for them, it's not a question of me.
It's about how many times I <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I learned that to 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is, how is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever and <unk>
And all of that is true, but it's only a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, it's insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask people to ask, with a little bit cooler legs and the brightest hair, it will be happier.
They only have to meet a group of models, because they have the most bright hair, the brightest hair, and the more of the clothes to the fashion -- but it's probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to be aware of this talk, I hope that you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception we have of the success and of failure.
Thank you.
photography has been my passion since it was enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> pictures -- and I wasn't the <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum amount of care.
Indeed, most of them were taken away from random.
My story begins when, <unk> in the city of New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me off this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and the 5.
He gave the chance we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York City in a <unk> journey.
This is when we start to ask the tourist that they were going to take the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, never no one has <unk>
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a couple of weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a five-year girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a particular journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how it feels and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope for an illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the trips we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in the dry and pointed a red <unk> of the grocery store that <unk> small at the previous <unk>
And I described to me what I felt about five years standing in that same place.
<unk> that reminded of his heart of <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York are universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we created is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that brings the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to show up in the photo, and you don't have to go back to someone and her, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk>
First, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter -- as a <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press -- <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't have clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of diseases.
<unk> are <unk>    And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.     There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World, they find primarily in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World World, where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why are the <unk> they are important -- first of all, provide ecological ecological services that are <unk>
It's our natural trash <unk>
<unk> the next to the bone.
They help kill all of them, they help all absorb the anthrax that not being for them would be killed, and it would cause great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times longer in <unk> and this has huge ramifications on the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have tremendous importance.
They've been associated with the old <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the developers, and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and lower Egypt.
In mythology <unk> <unk> was the <unk> God and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, we make a lot of important <unk> to open <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight <unk> species in Kenya, which six are at the end of the <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being depressed is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In the South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because the consumption of livestock has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there have been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- and when you have a <unk> <unk> you have a huge amount of time in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind wind in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up of the lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines is doing this to birds.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of dead <unk> to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so that you will focus on a higher problem it's not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments in <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciate the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government, and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed this, because he saw them fly without any energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much longer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- but I was not am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory de <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that the Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
So instead of that, everything you would do -- it was <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach the people of airplanes.
So we came up with <unk> <unk> to this absolutely magnificent Valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach them to grow tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all of them who were all interested in doing that, and so they were going to give them to come to work, and sometimes they don't have --  --  -- and we were sure that the local, in as low valley, had not had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible to do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Kyoto of the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
So we got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato sauce, and in Zambia, to this size.
And we can't believe, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and red at night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're going to be no <unk>
He thought that we only had the Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa but then I saw what Americans were doing, what they were doing, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that gave them to the <unk> people of Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donor countries, we've dropped the continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners -- we are <unk> missionaries and we treat people only two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if I was my kids, you have a long time.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if I was my <unk>
So white Africa are called <unk>
And that book gave me a slap in the face, the little guy is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
It should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a stick on the ground, and he said, you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to have the 27 years to just respond to people, and actually invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of becoming a better person.
So what do you?
It doesn't come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat in a coffee. We sat down at a pub.
We have zero infrastructure here.
And what do we do? We turned into friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years ago, and years ago, I had this idea: Why is it not for us, for one time to get to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for a time, I would be <unk> but not in <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
<unk> entrepreneurs will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
To the smartest people of their community, you don't even know them, because they don't go to their public <unk>
What do we do? We worked one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor who sets up with you in your house, at the table table, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia, South Africa.
I was doing a Ph.D. in the time, trying to move away from this sad trash that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 different projects, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How can you do that? I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
So I was <unk> and --  --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 500,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most great business office of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of corporate spirit.
So now we have <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people are in <unk> they want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to go to talk to you with you.
You have to offer you -- it needs to be great to the <unk> and then you have to come up with mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you more about this tomorrow?
local local people -- that's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we have a fossil revolution -- it's not renewable -- <unk> and one moment to each other, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of supporting <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
We don't have the technologies to do that.
Who will invent technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that was in an advanced magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year, he got together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York City in 100 years, and the bottom line was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist.
Why? Because it analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York City to the <unk> <unk> six million horses. And the manure produced by six million horses -- it would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we had in New York.
So what does it happen? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States of the United States appeared in the United States companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
In another way, they're not going to come to talk to you with you.
Then, you have to offer an absolute <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell -- has to be fantastic. You have to count a fantastic marketing marketing -- and you have to count a great financial <unk>
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, selling and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
So we've looked at and observed in the 100 iconic companies of the world --  <unk> Ford, all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all the success companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by one person.
No word -- but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't only when it began.
No one begins a company itself alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a little bit of a small business environment in <unk> in bars with their dedicated dedicated to their dedicated dedicated people to do with this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who is going to ask you, what needs it?
What can you do that? Can you do it?
Well, you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us around us can help us have a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why we're not going to change a lot of knowledge even though of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores, so our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief to the giant <unk> that give shadow, <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always going to go to the music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful band of the world, but also one with the largest U.S. properties in the U.S.
I live near this house, and I thought how could it turn into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
his death was sudden and it <unk>
I thought a lot in death and I thought, much about death and <unk>
And this made me a deep gratitude for the time I lived and lived in the time.
He was clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I'm going to try and keep this look in my day-to-day life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to get to catch on the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned on the wall of this home house on a giant board and he painted on her sentences to be able to die.
So <unk> could take a <unk> to think about their lives and share aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day I was full of the wall and I was still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I want to be <unk> I want to be <unk>  "Before I want to sit at the <unk> <unk>
"Before I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before dying I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before I want to die. Once more."
"Before I want to go to the <unk>
"Before dying I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laughing -- and I was comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> -- this is about giving the reflection and the <unk> and of remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages of people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues of the civic center we made a kit and now have been taken walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relations with other people.
In our era of distractions that's much more important than ever, to find the ways of conserving the perspective and to remember that life is a brief and weak life.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we're going to prepare for death is one of those things that makes us more power.
So if you think about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than individuals and as a community and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help us improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, and very <unk>
Don't talk about it, but transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
Whatever it happens is happening what's going on.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
I don't care about religious differences and notice about it: it's never <unk>
When he sing our childhood, trying to say to be words that I don't even have to be able to do -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we had when I was four years old, I imagined in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't agree with them.
And in fact, because your minds are not attached to the concept of society, they are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though I didn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing -- that they were <unk> and a certain thing.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, to learning, and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual it shapes each other, which is so different from Gando.
And all around the world, every 20 minutes, are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, not very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like laying cars around the room, and you would look at the washing washing machine, and eat anything that would be in the <unk>
As I grew up, it would be more different, and the difference was made easier.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature of pure nature, a child that was seeing the world without understanding -- a human being that had never <unk>
Oh what?
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I would have to be just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about the individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> goes on the beauty that give us the difference and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It only means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could turn it a single thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, and you would have to be normal.
It can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the difference that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inside -- and honestly, the search for normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is dying at the time that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little thing that must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a media teacher, which would give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was afraid.  I was really <unk> of these students with their great books and their big books and their great words and great words.
But when I develop those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat when I had these conversations with students that were teaching me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience a wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and health care care -- each other, and if we don't know this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the structure structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, they can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> isn't the same as making them <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said everything as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate with clearly their science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and stories and analogies are ways of getting it to their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  So what do we do the <unk>
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective and it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that I really inspired the single design of the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple line, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs, and then provide graphs that we would take to our other senses and create a more profound sense of understanding what they get.
I think these are just some keys that can help each other open the door and look at the country of wonders that's science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've fixed this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of my Oxford words is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that it defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> -- that you search for a public charge no matter party, and that, when you win it for the pure use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something about the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, that Parliament British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
He was thrown into the office in London and <unk> but he had the good courage to deal with them, and at the end had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of the freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics are, I want you to go back to America, right after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington -- his leader.
You didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They presented all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And I don't even have the idea that you could have the idea that you could be elected King for a given date.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired -- <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
He read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the <unk> House was against the <unk>
The House House didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King if he did it or her "10 ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> title of it, and you wanted to give it a little bit more <unk> and you would have happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. It had been before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> but it really was a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who will take it seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate not <unk>
We can learn three really interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama has luck to go there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  -- we might be able to keep waiting for the next few years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and I want to tell you about -- is that the U.S. president of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear <unk> the biggest economy of the world and a fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So in the end, I won the <unk>
They got his headline <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear head and so on.
So at the end the Senate won and the <unk> House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that they're the president of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually the reality change much more the words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to the land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the darkness, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices who talk about it, but most of all, that flock of male <unk> and stones and stones with tools.
As everyone else, I carry an cheap flashlight of light that would be held to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole.
And my hand, and I suddenly remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost control and she lost a foot on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep of that hole in that hole in their lives without pays and reward and, often, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home but they may never do it, because they're <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents -- and, in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the Summit of <unk>
Among all of the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGOs who is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as much grade.
When we ended up talking to me, I felt very sad, I honestly was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me like a stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the <unk> <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
But even the thought was my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of African Africans for all of the <unk> slave <unk>
150 years ago the cost of a slave farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S.
The equivalent of about 50,000 today.
However, today can be transferred to entire families for generations for <unk> <unk>
<unk> slavery creates revenues from more than <unk> billion dollars a year across the world.
A lot of them have been <unk> with false promises of good education, and better work to then find out that they're required to work with a threat of violence, and they can't escape.
Today slavery operates on the <unk> the goods produced by slaves they have value, but those who produce these are disposable people.
<unk> exists in nearly the whole world, and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick box.
This weird show and invention was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, whole families -- whole families -- in a heavy <unk> <unk> mechanically mechanically hot, bricks in their heads, and they take them up at the same time, and they take them down to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
He had no fun to eat it, not to eat, and the severe <unk> I had ever pee
It was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work, and I was sitting there, like, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was at my very quickly, and he said, <unk> I don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I wasn't aware of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for his release and he trusted that he <unk>
As much to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying stones for miles per capita terrain until trucks waiting to bottom.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children who owns them and the children would send them to their head with <unk> <unk> made of storms and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 and 17 hours a day, because this has been so all his life.
They have nothing with what a <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness -- I felt that it would be difficult for me to work in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
I was sort of led to some stairs that was giving up to this dirty <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant rather well.
<unk> as you know what they are, they are local for forced prostitution to <unk>
They have small rooms and private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of the seven years -- they're forced to entertain customers and alcohol.
Each place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall, and divided by a curtain.
The workers often suffer abuse of their clients.
From the <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be caught up in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the stairs where I <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a topic that is so difficult -- it's important to point out that slavery is even sexual trafficking, and it's happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> and the list can move on.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as a sex slave
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages in which there were whole families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
<unk> hands are from the father, the blue <unk> and red, of their kids.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid and <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, can be able to go out of this house, someday and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went into a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family family in a boat, two older siblings, some young kids, some young kids, it makes sense, right?
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families, and they forced them to work with a lot of these boats in the lake, even though not knowing swimming.
This is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it -- that his little fly was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches of trees are connected in the lake <unk> they often catch networks and kids, <unk> and by fear, they become the water to release the branches.
Lots of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run out, and as all of life has been treated with Spiderman.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when I was the last networks, but they had been working from the one of a country.
It was cold, and <unk>
And it is to point out that these networks make over 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a hut where the <unk> <unk> to victims of slavery.
Kofi health, is possible.
Who will come to be because of someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a young girl who was suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to do it on a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the path, we would let us go out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path and he said, "This is the path, this is the <unk>
And as we start down, we took the <unk> that we would have the path and after walking near an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures of my head to the chest of my head to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in one of course, and we had in front of a holes of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs and while they were trying to gold gold, they have <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a good part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well, they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have up to 90 feet and these people have been carrying heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area where they run the stone to be able to extract the gold out.
To the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the face, we see a lot less fortunate and also children.
These are all victims of democracy and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up as this victim of T.B. and the <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When he died his father he took him to work with him in the mines.
When you die their uncle, you <unk> it to <unk> the debt of the uncle to be a slave in the mines.
When I met her, I had worked on the 14 years and the spinal cord cord that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors were saying it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he has been liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, which makes me much respect.
I want to throw light over slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted to know that we'll have witness to them and we're going to do everything we can to help change their lives.
I really think that if we can see ourselves about others as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate <unk> as <unk>
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I'm going to think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know about.
I hope that these images wake up a force in the people you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn up a fire, and that fire <unk> light about slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue living in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
And I'm doing applied math and there's a particular problem for the person who <unk> we are like <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to tell you what I do.
dance is one of the more human activities.
We got rid of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- that we will see later on.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training. A high level of skill and probably some initial <unk> that can be able to have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease destroy this extraordinary skill as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in their age, was a <unk> a ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet accident.
Over the last few years has been done so much in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need a <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress to measure the progress of progress in a very objective way, and ultimately the only way we know if there is a cure to be when we have an objective <unk> and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the movement are no biological markers -- so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, never done that.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could be able to do the test they would be able to do the test they can do the stress test.
Wouldn't it be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars on the <unk>
So what I want to do -- as a good way for a while, you see, in some sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sound when we talk to talk to talk to talk to you as a dancers of a vocal ballet -- because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound and we all have the <unk> for example.
And as the ballet doesn't require a level of training.
Think about the time that leads to a child to learn to talk.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal ropes as <unk> and as Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> it also affects <unk>
On the bottom card you can see an example of <unk> irregular <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more expensive, and it's after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they use existing infrastructure.
It's not necessary to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also testing based on a voice are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost as <unk> it appears to a massive scale.
These are some great goals to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties of patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
<unk> high-speed use we could get goals.
We could do <unk> mass <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk>
We have a chance to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we have the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's disease, can be able to go under a price and leave recordings for some cents. And I'm very pleased to announce that we've already reached the percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't it?
What would you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What's happening is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You can see, some people may not have <unk> you may not do it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances -- it's important because we're looking for <unk> the benefits of confusion in search for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to make a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on the mobile network as well, what we would have the project. We now have 99 percent precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March March 2011, I was <unk> in the city of New York.
We are <unk> creatures.
We would be <unk> in the darkness, and we have no windows and large, we avoid the solar light.
We do the thin standard models that we do is even more <unk> the perfect perfect skin, even more perfect -- we can do the impossible to be able to do it to the press, and then some of us are really artists with a talent for many years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11th of 2011, I saw since my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was happening in Japan.
Soon a long time later, an organization where it was <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as a part of the feedback team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we learned that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I went to <unk>
It's a little town of fishermen located in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by power.
<unk> water level reached over 24 feet of height and over three kilometers inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> debris from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime and leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks as much as those volunteers found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of people around the peoples of around <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that these people had <unk>
While I was talking about the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave all of all that they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help us in a center of the people.
It helped clean the bathrooms -- the huge, huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day to <unk> my photos.
This was exciting and inspirational had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to go beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some who had more than a hundred years ago, some of them were still in the top of the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people that could do the same thing.
So that night I walked on Facebook and I went to some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
He was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to have a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be so tragic as I have the <unk>
Over the time of time, they came for lucky luck and they needed more <unk> so he went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 people were offered to help.
By two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July we had a <unk> town north of <unk>
One time a week we use our scanner in the <unk> libraries that had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we have in <unk> is a different story, dependent on the <unk> of the photos.
I could have an hour. It could be for weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw practically by hand, using the areas whose color and detail had no destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that are heavily covered in pure water, covered of bacteria, with algae -- and even oil, all of it along with the time of time -- I continue <unk> by hand it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't turn it down to less than it was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more of the pictures of <unk>
As once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman that brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face, you could not have been able to reconstruct the images in a single picture and the whole picture.
When I collected his photos shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the debris quite far away from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues was <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the commissioned to close the barriers to the waves.
He had to go into the water while the <unk> <unk>
Her young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in a different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find all of his family and knowing that they had no time.
The day I gave her pictures his son, her younger son was 14 years.
To her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something that he could go back to look, something that could remember in the past day, when everything in his life changed it or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had been attached to <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean them up to the hands of the <unk> and the great <unk> -- the vast majority of them returned to their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all around the world helped us bring 90 families hundreds of pictures of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of all, in ink to <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, a relationship, and somebody loved one.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would bring to us, but the first thing that we might look for.
This was about the project, of restore little bits of humanity, to bring them up to somebody their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that you get.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them sort of connected to some of them with something bigger -- using a talent for something that are not thin models of perfect skin, perfect skin.
And I would end up to finish this email. He sent it down the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was doing, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl -- gathering around a baby, <unk> because a picture of my family my grandmother, I and my daughter recently hangs down our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs, are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us awe and curious about this picture of a bullet that goes through an exhibit in an exhibit of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion million frames a billion.
I present a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow camera of light light.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or to see the inside of the body without going to use X-ray and really challenge the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it up and put it up and put it up in a second one, and you know, in a number of <unk> create a driver of photons of just a millimeter long.
And that packet of photons, is going to travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common factor.
If you take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons take into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   -- remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this data to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle of a photons of photons that starts to <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Some of the light is going to be <unk> and we start to see these <unk>
A lot of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in a variety of directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the thoughts of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if you take a common and ordinary bullet and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow camera to about 10 billion times, how long think it would take us sitting to the film?
One day? A week, actually, every year.
It would be a very boring movie -- a slow <unk>
And what about testing with <unk>
You can see the waves. You can see the waves, of the tomato table and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a photo, I think, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a composition of it.
But if you look at one more and more of this sauce, you'll realize that, as the light gets rid of the cold, it's still bright. Don't be <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside its inside and it turns out, after a lot of <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So why do we create this camera at NASA today.
As hell. You know, if we take a picture at the lower exhibition, you get very little <unk>
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> show -- so you just go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of 600 million times, and we recorded over and over again, with a very <unk> <unk> we took these data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all these data in crude and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they can become invisible, they
And if a new power of a <unk> future would let me see behind the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not rocket fiction. We have already constructed.
On the left, it's our <unk>
From the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It has very good temporal resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser can record a photo on a thin, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our rebuilding us.
We have things to explore before we pull this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars, we could create cars that have <unk> collisions with what's going to the <unk>
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light in the open windows of open windows and open windows.
Or, we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood -- this is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization of visualization for us to solve the problems of <unk> for the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself a scientist, became the science of art, a art of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected every time are not only for scientific viewers but we can see that we can see we can see we can do it.
And creating a new form of computer photography with slow camera and code code.
And we look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves, it's just a little bit of a second.
But here is also something fun.
If we look at the waves.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding range of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you a individual.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, she can take her to <unk> and get to be popular.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and living in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that <unk> for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who of the legs have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Put your cell phone, you go.
<unk> A Android, an altar.
It's so much of all of you today have a mobile phone.
But I'm going to talk about my phone, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 different pieces of information.
It's a raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this is telling you that every European company, every provider of all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and two years ago, in his phone company, or his Internet provider or the Internet.
And across Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet, all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everyone said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin, and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some of you even said this would be the <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Asia.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
You can store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please give me all the information I had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to me, and I didn't have a concrete response, it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make it a lawsuit -- because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, let's not give you this information.
At the end of the <unk> I agree.
<unk> demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
In the meantime, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 thousand information.
At first I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk>
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show you people what the data mean?
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open organization, we did this.
This is a visualization for six months of my life.
You can go up and down, go backwards and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to go on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not only about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk about a couple of time.
Then they call me some friends and they call me a little bit of them.
And then you call the other, and the other one another, and we end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other is how long they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who are talking to who, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is store at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not every one of the <unk> <unk>
Because today, the state agencies, and companies want to store so much of us as possible to us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not <unk>
When you go home to your representative that only because corporations and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your telephone company, what are you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to show them that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi, "How happens?
It's not enough.
Hi, "How happens?
My name is <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral paralysis, and that's why I <unk> all the time.
look.
It's <unk> I'm like a blend of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it's not <unk>
And no one would be able to <unk> my mom and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, though they are.
Just by accidents, as the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want you to have any of you here today.
It feels bad for me, because somewhere in life, you want to be a disabled.
Let's go.
Christmas Christmas are at the mall, drive in circles for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places.
And they say, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the little C. is only one of them.
There will be a <unk> of the <unk> I had the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, and I lived in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might do that.
I am in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial age.
I also love that if I want to walk my home to New York, it can be done.
Thank you so many people with cerebral <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
My mantra of my father was: "Can you make it <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and I would argue that I was, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- we all had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk to the five years to put my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another cookie, that used to hang up a dollar in front of me so that I <unk>
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in the child in the child was walking like a <unk> <unk> who has got a lot of <unk>
As you grow up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 cars, and they are still all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 -- and that politicians think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
People that I grew up with no trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot of hunger on the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat to live three whole months without eating three months without eating, so <unk> at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents could not pay the physical therapy, so I sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer holiday on the expense of Jersey, I couldn't go.
I was going on my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we would not go to Palestine all the <unk> we would be in <unk>
On the summer summer to often my father tried to <unk> so I would drink milk from <unk> to put me warm up on his back, I was amazed at the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water left my eyes and like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the time.
I should say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can turn it into your head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination, and I got a grant to the <unk> University of Arizona, because I went in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the <unk>
All of me.
I did all of the tasks of the less clever tasks in my classroom, and also their classrooms.
Every time I did a scene of the glass of glass my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with brain <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk>
By the end of it, at the end of the <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm going to be <unk>
I didn't have the paper.  He gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> I went to the CEO of the theater, crying and crying -- historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that they could not do the risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk trials, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that literally had been born and gave it to an actress with no cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
He went back home, and my first tour <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream was made true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> didn't see me more than <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> didn't have a white, they're not white, with disability.
Just give them to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common.
So I made me <unk>
In my first tour he took New York City from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he was at high speed for the highway of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
He worked in clubs around the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know I know you never heard that little nasty little bit disgusting that says that women are not fun, and they find us very funny.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the festival of the <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and the time to remind me to <unk> <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
It was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma challenge of disability.
My great opportunity was in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by cable behind Keith <unk>
I walked as if I was at a graduate dance, I was headed to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the CEO and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I stood on the desktop desk to not go out of the screen through the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I was at the end of my opportunity and <unk> I knew I didn't go back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was kind of like <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that children are <unk> but never <unk> from me and no more than a child.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like <unk>
"This is <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What does it have?
We really should pray for this."
A <unk> suggested I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is so visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make any of someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the biggest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I don't have <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with the media, and I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and everyday life.
Maybe if there would be more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we need all of the society to teach our children well.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by <unk> red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk>
I came to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible James <unk>
<unk> the Arab world have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give children refugee refugees -- a small part of what my parents would do.
It was the only time my father saw me living live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a young people.
I don't know his name, but I know their story.
He lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives the little village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, not <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city to the outskirts of <unk>
And after maybe a year was <unk> nothing.
A day is a gentleman who offers him to take it to <unk> after dinner, and <unk>
He knows a bunch of dynamic people, which gives him a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send your family's family.
They show a young lady.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a bomb.
That child of that little town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were at the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child of a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity waiting to start his future, waiting for a perspective perspective, and this was the first thing that was arrived.
This was the first thing that took it out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story repeats in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> in London, who search for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, for well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't have <unk> opportunities, the history of the <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to the <unk> to be the history of cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 doesn't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I came back to <unk> last month, and I went to the <unk> Hospital.
I remember going to be in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen it forced me to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to go to a few leaders in a business program.
<unk> about 90 young leaders <unk>
We sat and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges that the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because because I was a college college college college -- I was frustrated, was the perfect white for <unk> and other organizations, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to come to the B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way.
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk>
It started <unk> Will you go to local residents who don't normally have <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is sometime to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why do this story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so efficient.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was attending one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the top of the corporate initiative and how to be innovative, and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago -- and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic since abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer was: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, you could survive the hard climate <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers, creating gardens in homes, and the companies in the city, and now he's working on the creation of the first public park of <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
They want to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink immunity.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for a NGOs, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So we inspire young people and create a corporate spirit culture, it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance to <unk> in development and actually put it into their businesses.
They would give the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that need to go from the conception to creation, and you will create a <unk> for urban growth.
For me, private spirit is something more than to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park in <unk> this is how it does, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent to rent and keep <unk>
He gave them a chance to escape from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> in the north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be on the way that we had -- we almost can pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake.
So behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four acres of <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
Do no matter how <unk> or where you are, the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> <unk> our waste, to reason about 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does the uniform feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through his shirt and interviewed people in offices and facility around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
He needed to get better.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I have <unk>
And operated the mechanical mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as ecological as believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you would be very quickly, so quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of bringing over their tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of FBI <unk> the waste of waste is one of the ten more dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You are coming and moving into the traffic all day and move around you.
They just want to be <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that are often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about how much of the trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves come.
It's also as a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
I think the stigma is particularly ironic because I think strongly that <unk> waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first license to public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of waste and efficient and effective and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers inherent us in very real ways.
We'd been controlled by decades and centuries to come back and begin to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If you can't get rid of the old we don't have a space for the new thing that the motors of the economy are starting to fail when it's in danger itself.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing your relationship.
And then what I call our everyday average speed is required.
So I mean simply at the speed that we used to move into the <unk>
We don't have <unk> or <unk> and we took it to us with our cup of coffee, our bag of water -- our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know there are a force force on the other side that would take away from it.
So I want to show you a couple of ways to think about the harvesting of waste that maybe help you reduce the stigma and be able to design that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every single day every single time.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you go.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow has always been in a form or another.
One day after September 11th of 2001, I listened to the <unk> of a waste of waste in the street, grabbed my little son, and I went downstairs and there was a man doing his journey of <unk> paper like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her for doing his work, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's go well.
We're going to be right."
Soon after that I started researching the waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> working together many times and made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be OK.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet, as a species, we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human of your labor labor.
Natural waste -- what we think when we talk about junk it is three percent of the amount of waste of nation.
It's a remarkable feature.
So on the flow of his days and his lives, the next thing to look at somebody whose work is clean the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming a part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally dependent on the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis of different perspectives are becoming an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center of a lot of stories in the capital.
This is the kind of building that showed us as a team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
At the beginning, these buildings are almost empty because they have very big stores that people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because of the lining of crystals it creates heat in the inside, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not be happening because it is a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees every year.
And third, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa or with Ethiopia.
It's a death penalty of a place that is so rich in the culture and the traditions.
In our first visit, in our first visit to Ethiopia, actually actually held with the old market that is this structure to the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to create external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a building, of various stories, applying these principles.
So the next challenge was presented to <unk> the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth area, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, joining all the entries from the building.
And this extends up with an electrical <unk> which creates a space to the free air in the building that was driven by its own shape, and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with little businesses, which changes every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that was going to go to the local <unk>
And I got to think about a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air, and also the light, but in a form of <unk>
Then we inspired us in these beautiful buttons from the <unk> <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that will leave the air and light in a way controlled the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light of the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not very easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center. It wasn't what I <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because at the end of accounts there were more local <unk>
And then the idea of the facade was far more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass material, but also because it was not needed air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where the electricity was cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public space with areas of <unk> and bars that would create this oasis of urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, they collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the next year, because we go through the fifth of the construction.
So the second example is a master plan for a lot of apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, it needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also his environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access of access to almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we made was extend it to extend the streets of existing -- creating 12 similar blocks similar to size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors of <unk> with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So I would have a scheme to argue that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then on the lower plant, we have all the connections for the <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that can set up a higher density in the upper levels and a lower density on the ground plant.
And I also think of this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project that is almost like to give the community space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and go up and do activities such as a running race in the morning, or jump from a building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lifetime of people change communities and local economies, at the same pace as the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have a goal to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great amounts of very bright hair, and a little bit of a nice tree <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of myself until I <unk> my sinister plan.
I was a time after the output was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's teacher on grades.
And then I did.
<unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit of like this.
All of them.  And I set up to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my others had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, no imagination.
I put them to all of the rows of <unk> and myself as a line of so just to be there, because I <unk>
It's still surprising to me.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I'm going to tell me the reason I was bothered by that this little girl was so small, was so good for <unk>
I was going to take care of you.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies are suffering from jealousy.
It's also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
So we know that <unk> are the number one cause of antibiotics in the U.S.
And yet, I have never seen a study that we had a study that would be <unk> or the sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the laboratory that you study <unk> in all of their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there was no longer any literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> <unk> and there would be no <unk>
There would be no king of <unk> and <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There are no <unk> I know that it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and, in terms of the extent that it has all of them.
This year was 100 years of his <unk> and he was looking for the time -- <unk> the most <unk> study of the sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, everything we might have --  -- and thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile the sleep.
We think in a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how long that picture.
Do we forgot how complexities it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's look at why well together, the novel, and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the emissions that are reduced to the person to their wish, and they are a <unk> <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel society, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the life of other people, and those stories make us feel awful because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
And to be an audience, and we know exactly exactly how bad detail to <unk> the knife -- right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understood.
All that she makes for me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool taste that <unk> it picks up his collection of <unk> <unk> in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if you wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to acknowledge that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like great amounts of bright hair, and the nice little <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> ties to be good at the language of the jealousy.
When you look at it on your agony of soon you hear behind the doors and you go back to the <unk> of his lover -- then those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or to look at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make it look like <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for the truth, a real glamorous truth in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways for <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to be that that makes us suffer, it causes us to have a range of much more profound feelings and vital feelings that can be <unk>
It's telling us we're going to look for <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> would reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this very <unk>
There's some other emotion to us with us our <unk> our awful ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at that <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who had been consumed with the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which was not <unk> in what he did his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everyone knew it.
The poor creature was under <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without knowing <unk> <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was turning into the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> are going to look at it intensity but without precision.
In fact, how much more <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of violent or illegal <unk>
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me when I was eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years old, was captured by being created by a fake account of Facebook from the one that would be sent horrible messages to itself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to get her to the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to tell that when you go back with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How massive if we have <unk> Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorite one.
She is a very weird character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of society, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes out of <unk> or want what you have to get to the <unk> of your being, and you get a little bit of <unk> and it's under the floor, your name, you take your <unk> cow your bank accounts at your name.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in terms of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not secure, when they're in the <unk>
Let's go to the George Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius at the time.
But I have always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of <unk> <unk> that needs to <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius -- but it <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their aid, but it would be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of Six <unk> once you go down, go down, and you go back to all of their solution, and you say, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And it tells me there's no person in <unk> <unk> who would not want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It looks like treating the <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute -- it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next one are on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It might still be so stupid.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to it?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can stick with it.
But I like the <unk>
So while we hope that we're going to remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is going to be able to do it.
<unk> used the <unk> to the table.
And look at what the freshwater does, the <unk> Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
So the 21st of July of 1969, intentions, flew out of the skull.
He said, Armstrong and Stanford were alone, but their presence in the gray gray surface, was the culmination of a collective process.
And the Apollo program was the largest instead of peace in the U.S. history.
To arrive at the moon -- NASA spent about 180 billion dollars a day, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo did work at about 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including <unk>
But before the Apollo <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which is behind the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you start?
They had a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the own words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask why <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why do we scale the most <unk>
Three years ago, why fly over the <unk>
Why do I play Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> it was not just a victory of the West about this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the significance of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
<unk> on a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and he eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse -- or a boat with candle, but in 1969, the Apollo <unk> crew flew for 80 miles -- / hour.
From 1970, no human being returned to the moon.
No one has gone faster than the Apollo <unk> <unk> and the <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the technology would solve that technology would solve as we go to Mars, create a clean energy -- create a clean energy -- create a clean energy.
I remember seeing the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk> <unk> the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that virus happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists had <unk> and they have been enriched with trivial toys -- things like <unk> apps and social media, or algorithms that speed up the <unk>
There's nothing bad for most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation -- in the Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> of the years that would be <unk> Microsoft, Microsoft, Microsoft Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley tells us that markets are <unk> in concrete, the incentives that teachers offer to the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment led to <unk> creation of ideas -- for the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk cocaine, they were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred little investment.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technologies as energy -- that they need a huge capital, and whose development is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and more complicated things.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we have <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars it would require a political decision that popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar power, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic <unk>
<unk> and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind and oil and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative power sources that can compete in the price. They don't exist.
Now, Thanksgiving entrepreneurs and economists are according to what political and international treaties -- development of <unk> energy -- a significant increase in the research and development development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of the current climate policy that we will see an energy policy of America, or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like. It's not to be.
We know for a time of time that famines are a result of failure of food.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can do things like harvest -- or the systems for the storage and <unk> of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon president was declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we suddenly find out there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and effective treatments.
The difficult problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and -- but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders, and the population must want to solve the problem, institutions must support the <unk> it must be actually a problem of <unk> and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it has to be able to solve it with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like <unk> the solar system.
In general, to go to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I was not even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about the trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there have been a great decline in trust, it's a very general belief, in the time.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about the subject.
First <unk> why people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It takes me to think that it may have gone down into some activities or institutions and that could have increased others.
I don't have clear.
But I can go to the opinion, and <unk> surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over the time, there's not many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> but nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half of the road.
But this evidence is enough?
What <unk> opinion is, of course, opinions are, of course.
What else can you say?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people believe when you do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I would probably be able to ask, "What do they do for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust them, but in another no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official man, or kind of person, it's going to be a uniform in all the cases.
I could, for example, say I rely on a certain teacher teacher that I know to give the kind of reading -- but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about confidence in the more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence because they try to <unk> the good judgment of the fact of trusting something or someone.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
It's not the goal that I <unk>
I was going to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm <unk> not trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings on the very <unk> -- called Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, I think in them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart target in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it -- he says, yes, yeah, it means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be a sense of trust.
But yes, on the other hand, they're not better, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the email, because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see that you would have their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I don't have many friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If that's like this, I don't have not <unk>
But that's what we're going to do to go back before that trust.
So trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build accountability systems for all kinds of rules for all kinds of <unk> professionals, officials and so on.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer to make the <unk> <unk> that will be going to go in at know."
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and you know, that the accountability system that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the test of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
So we had all that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you have to be worthy of confidence and you give them to the people who are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people or politicians, people are worthy of determine whether other people or politicians, people are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple action -- the <unk> which doesn't do it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task reconstruct the trust, puts the things into the other way around.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve the trust.
But the confidence in the last is because you give it a lot of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have ever been given.
You have to give them enough to you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't go through it for all people, all the time.
But you also have to contribute <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That's every day, everywhere, it makes it the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple example.
The store where I buy my socks -- it says that I can tell you that I can do <unk>
I carry it up and you get the money, or you change them for the color that I like.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of confidence and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing to is not very hard to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers, we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the display that the imagination can be seen.
So this separation has been <unk> getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than one of it is less than one another, the patient's <unk>
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started to figure out how to <unk>
So I created this tool that we get into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is its physical body at the bottom.
designers can give up their ideas directly in 3D -- and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with digital information using all the skill of your hands?
In the division of Science Research at Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a little space on the keyboard in a <unk>
You know, a transparent bombsight with electronic cameras, to detect your fingers and face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of 3D space, and grab the nerve directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can go through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down every single screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we have <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information comes towards us?
So many of us will be bought and returned to the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device in the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of only seeing pixels in space, how can we make it physical physicists so we can make it physical and <unk>
How would you be a future like that?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my <unk> Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> we created this single physical <unk>
This fits imam behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation -- <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movement can be <unk> and <unk> and they're always in the physical world.
You can actually teach them physically and a distance and the famous shot from Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality of the physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or the textbooks -- this is a real experience and palpable that you can play and feel.
But what is most fascinating is to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start to act directly about us as a part of the physical world around us without having to get it from our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was amazed to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the American Revolution, they create strongly that there was only a powerful path to the <unk> a safe and <unk> work.
But no matter whether job would like it or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer, though.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer, must start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
Until I wrote to the director of school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult gave him the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends were <unk> but they were kids, no authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life is a great lecture for the rest of the second class to be the only thing to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to search for another <unk>
No one to me, I wanted to <unk>
<unk> to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> -- I came to the U.S. in 1995, and what the first books was on here?
The ones that were <unk> of course.
"The Good <unk> tries for American <unk>
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but pretty strange.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> guilt -- and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my <unk>
<unk> lots of perspectives.
For example, at first this map I thought was outside because this is what students in China learn.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all research fields like religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> provides a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked to us, why not do it in the <unk> life.
So I started reading books.
You may be able to be <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and the duty to make it Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path, <unk> Thomas <unk> On the path of the <unk> Alan <unk> instead of miss in the cultures, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feel or powerless before.
Having a <unk> dream, it's really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that achievement is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the dreams, of where the passion comes from.
So even a dream. It can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books. I'm here, happy, living again with purpose, and clearly, most of the time.
So books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical care.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked at the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> stood on the couch of my office took up the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as the first <unk>
And I played a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could deal with it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex led to the <unk> became easy to just move the head while he <unk> the solution.
"The 30 is the new <unk> he said, probably.
You start to work later, you have children later, it has children later, until the death goes next.
By the time as Alex and I had time to have a time.
But I was shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex I'd talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Oh yeah, it's coming with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like I was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "It's not not, but maybe it was <unk>
Moreover, the best time to work in terms of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit after what they were, but it didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a break in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and I had real consequences, not only for Alex and her loving life, but for careers, the future and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to the age of as long as the <unk>
Put your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away your dream -- I want to see. I want to look at it.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to 35 years.
So this means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give their life form for your life to have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people are <unk>
This public is going to be well, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half of Americans are married, and they're coming out with their future for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility goes to your top of 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> over their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has a <unk> impact.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called the adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in an adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the line of <unk>
So researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've called a <unk> which actually is the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their ambition and no absolutely anything.
And then every single day, cold, interesting as you or your children and daughters go to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't know. I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody said that while I start a race before the 30, all being right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had a better act, the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then somewhere around 30, the music and all began to sit on it.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but it doesn't make the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of you will start a career, to choose a city, to choose a city, and to have two children in a long period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show -- which is much harder and <unk> to do everything once to the <unk>
The middle age of middle-aged age is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want to do now.
He says that you can't have the son you want right now, or you can't give you a brother to your child.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sat in the room, and you talk about his <unk> "What was I doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma got to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said that I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend that showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I live a lot of <unk> very difficult, your previous life had been even more difficult.
It was often in our <unk> but then she was getting up with her, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day, Emma got his head on his legs and <unk> for almost every time.
He had just bought a brand new book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning I had with her many <unk> but then he was seeing the empty space that goes after the words -- "In an emergency thing, please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and I said, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a life better, and I knew that this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade of Emma was going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that every man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I said to Emma who would get rid of that identity crisis, and the identity of identity.
From identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know it: <unk> capital capital.
So now it's the moment for that other side of the other side of the country, of that <unk> of that company that you want to try to.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that should not tell -- that by the way, it's not exploration, it's not exploration, it's not.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would look at jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma who urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the young people who come together with friends with friends with similar minds with a similar thing to who you know what you know about, how do you think about it, how they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will go out almost always comes from their closest circle from the top.
The new things come from what are called the weak friends of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job, or they don't have work.
But the other half of them, and the weak ties are the way we get to this group.
Half of the jobs we created is never <unk> so knowing the chief of your neighbor is a way of getting a job of not published work.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know their friends.
And this was true when I was growing up, but as he <unk> Emma soon killed her family's family, when she has a partner and in his own family.
I said to Emma who time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone at Facebook are starting to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and it involves being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with anyone who will take them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped me get a work there.
That job supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend that I live.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man with a man who elected <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send a letter to say, "Now the emergency room space spaces are not enough.
The history of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles, who go somewhere from the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in your trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
Likewise, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even the next generation.
Here's my idea to spread to all the <unk> of the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege to say to the <unk> as Emma every day, <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get <unk> and use their weak ties to use your family.
Don't be define define why they didn't know what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management and a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to show them mathematics to students of seventh degree in public schools.
And as any professor, I made tests and test tests and test tests and trial.
I gave them tasks.
When the work came back, I <unk> grades.
So what struck me is that the I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going to be so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time for enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure differently.
It's the <unk> but what if we succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we try to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who would be <unk>
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in the competition.
We looked at <unk> teachers working in really hard slums. What teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the more effective to improve the results of the learning of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their job?
And who will make more money?
In all these very different contexts -- very different contexts -- a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion, and when you reach for a very long term.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
<unk> is embracing their future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students that did my sense of determination and then waited about over a year to see the people who are <unk>
It turns out that children are more likely to have significantly higher chances of <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> which matters <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about understanding is how little that knows about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development does it develop in kids?
What do I have to do to teach the children a solid job ethic for <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long-term <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I do know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are just not going to go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, complexity is often not related to it or it's even related to the <unk>
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing security, in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University, and this is the belief that the ability to learn is not that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when children read and learn about the brain, and how it changes and grows and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more prone to <unk> when you go back, because you don't think that is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger, and we need to be <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful, and we need to be a <unk> and we need to be willing to fail, and to start everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother -- the beauty and the figure of the Chinese characters.
From that time, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a abroad it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall Wall Wall Wall Wall Wall Wall Wall Wall Wall <unk>
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new new method and quickly learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw every one of the traces of every character in the right sequence in the correct sequence in the right sequence in the right.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand about 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signals of traffic signals of <unk> understanding the basic idea of pages or paper.
Today will start with eight to show you how the approach.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it is <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to be a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides as if they were shouting in a <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it's in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call sweeping to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they think many more characters.
A person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, two are crowd.
If one person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person within the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner's like <unk> in the whale.
A tree is two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a tree speaker is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two together, it becomes very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two stones together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put down the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and night.
The sun comes over the horizon.
A door to put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three girls together, have <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of thousands of characters, which is the same as a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in this of China.
So a sun next to us, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character to the left are two mountains there are one of the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, ours has become out.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a output.
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I come to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
The movie took his imagination for months.
Her favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and I was going to take a magic ball.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of a kind of industrial <unk>
However, the Oz of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> <unk> a guy who had a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl who was dressed as a guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big difference between the <unk> magician and all the movies we see today.
One is there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the Oz of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the <unk> of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the Oz of the Oz is that the most sensitive characters, wise people and even <unk> are women.
I started to see this when I did Star Trek <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
And at that time, I also had a child.
Just three years.
He was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  So it would appear in the room and he became impressed as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be issues of value, <unk> and <unk>
I would have the feeling that Luke an army to remove the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> <unk>
How do you win Dorothy his film?
By doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow <unk> and not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why are there so much capital, we have force in the movies for our kids, and so little of the <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I have not read so much about how children react to this stimulus.
I know by experience that the whistling <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have been served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss I really expect to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest is done, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost as if it's a kid, you have to be an animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and we stand at the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though kids, they are not really their target public.
They make a phenomenal job, when you teach girls how to protect the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to protect the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, so real and charming as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all of the time is continuing to appear on classic on classic every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and your son, or two men who raise a little girl.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, it eventually came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what a critical thing said when it came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has done a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not the roots of roots -- but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic comic artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation I'd had with a conversation about the movies of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> in the film, there is more of a female character that has lines?
So you have to do the <unk>
These women are talking to each other.
Their conversations are about something else besides the boy that I like to like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I see it in the movies that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good film, <unk>
Right? It <unk> <unk> <unk> a sense of consensus about what a Hollywood <unk> movie is.
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think I <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in an embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> <unk>
We have a lot of scenes that have deep and painful and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, the 100 more popular movies of them think they have as well.
<unk> It's not wrong.
It's not the same percent as the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress. That's okay.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to take away this room.
The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, "This is what he said, "This is what he said, "This is what he said, right?
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you don't have <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward -- which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very troubled statistic and we want to be <unk>
We have tools. We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that I <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> goes to <unk> yes, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their children to keep their children to keep their children to keep their children to keep their children to keep their children to keep their children to keep their children to
I mean, I think the list list is a way to do something really important, and I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is changing radically changes.
You have read about how new economy is changing the role of the way you care about the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star Star Star Star Trek character, you know what I <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant child.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my child.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories that I read to my <unk> you go and fight for more stories where you see his job is to join a team -- maybe a team leading for women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I loved was looking for sea cookies on the coast of Maine, because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was forced to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I do with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles length next to the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place to naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and we process using fake, suddenly the place looks like bright.
What you're seeing is the real chemicals of the landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an ancient city, called a lost city for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for more than 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of old art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this enormous <unk> <unk>
This area is enormous measures about <unk> by <unk>
Going forward, the Nile right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find it to the random that would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eye, and using baseball.
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that is seen inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborate with Egyptians doing <unk> work, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk>
So this means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of a several hundred years ago that date back from the Middle East, exactly the same period we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to be not too much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the expense of the Ottoman Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that coming back from the Ottoman Empire.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still haven't found <unk> here, but we would go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And most importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote of the Ottoman Bank, probably written in <unk> four years ago.
<unk> knowledge is the most <unk>
There's nothing like that.
So according to TED, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do the ideas really have been started in the summer of the started in a lost city, not for a long time, and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that is made.
Now let's take a group of <unk> <unk> in bicycles.
They are competing in a <unk> race and they go in direction to their front door to their <unk>
I need to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're sort of <unk>
They collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying through all places, wheels that go on on its side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door, and the threshold of the door, and the threshold of the door, you know, the threshold of the door, and the threshold of the door, you know, the threshold of the door, and you know, the threshold of the door, and
To the lobby, or what there is on the other side of the door, and you look at the quality of the light, and you look at the quality of light.
The <unk> <unk>
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> fortune cookie and you can smell it in the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter your living room.
In the room, and making a lot of the most of your imagination, just imagine 42 <unk>
He's with a little bit of clothes, dancing on his center of the center, singing <unk> <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a yellow brick path and from the oven come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Betty of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up for you.
OK. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that has done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, you look at them just once.
<unk> names of dozens and tens of strangers.
<unk> full-time poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have average memory.
Every ones that participate in this competition they say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques -- invented two and a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize the <unk> and the medieval academic used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was: How do I have no heard of this <unk>
And we were standing outside of the classroom of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, but a little bit <unk> said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know what? <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to show you to 42 <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of paper -- live on national television.
That would tell the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not 42 <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very weird journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what your potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how point our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he's based for the role of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library, Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treated on written memory, something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting stuff.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having a critical memory of literary memory and <unk> wasn't one thing as rare as you might look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also changed us.
They have changed the ground, and I would argue that we've changed very well.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a critical memory and a critical memory -- it's this unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is <unk> as this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how they do these people.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from London University of London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know -- it's going to be that it has brains in some form of a structural form or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects that the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI machine, <unk> your brains while <unk> faces and forms of snow. They found that in the memory champions they had different parts of the brain, different to others.
In fact, they looked at them, or they looked at a part of the brain that involves space memory and governance.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is running as a armed race where every year appears to someone with a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> order of <unk> digits <unk>
A half hour. Yes. Yes.
And while there's a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
So this illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's your <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you about the word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have <unk>
<unk> when they go back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you turn that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> sometime back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes from two and a couple of years ago in <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says like this. There was a poet called <unk> who sat at a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it was not going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and so soon it was the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But it didn't only kill them all of them, but it broke the <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So you could not get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single time.
He took the family of my hand, where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What you have to <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it doesn't matter if we're not good at all, to remember names or the word of the word of the word of our colleagues, we have visual and visual memory memory and space <unk>
So if I asked you to tell me, the first 10 words of the story that I just tell you about <unk> is very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who I was sitting on the horse speaker in his <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it a memory of the same way it had done it -- if you invited him to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And come up with some kind of an absolute ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine that entering your house, and seeing the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see 42 <unk> to remind you that little anecdote that you want to tell.
And then he walked in the kitchen, and the room that they would talk about would be that weird journey that was made by a whole year, and they have some friends to help you to remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, who are going to confuse but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase "The first <unk> would be like the first place in its palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating and I got inside of that.
And I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a lot about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people taking tests. I mean that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to get myself in the place.
So I started 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk>
And I found that this was <unk>
I would never have imagined that I <unk>
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What is actually about doing is to make it better and more and more to create the ability to create and imagine these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty popular.
This is me, using my standard team of training for the memory competition.
It's a pair of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered in a year before. He had the idea that I could put in a kind of <unk> <unk>
I thought this could be <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and mobile numbers, but actually this is not the point.
So these are just tricks.
Because that's based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> to benefit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories, <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deep to us.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing processing -- a kind of attention that most of them is not <unk> over there.
But the reality is, there's no shortcuts.
That's how things make <unk>
And if there's something I want to leave you with today, that's what I would do -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what we have is our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks to our side. We're going to be so <unk> that we don't even stand on the <unk>
And I learned firsthand that there are an amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living life, you have to be the kind of person who remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic -- so you know, just one place -- <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village named <unk> and this was my child room.
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom I'd shared with my sister.
And, between my room, and the bathroom, there was a balcony that I gave to the living room.
And there every time was watching television -- so every time I was going to go from my room to the bathroom, I would all see me, and every time I went to me, and I would wrapped up on a <unk> I all saw.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> and I hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
OK.
Those feelings, those emotions that felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or no division of area, but those connections are emotional <unk> that we feel about in the places that we have.
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Agency of Climate <unk>  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you're going to tell you about, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it so based on a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that they use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We used it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very helpful because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Library Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> he has this <unk> columns, brick brick -- red brick -- red brick -- who are <unk> what we're trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it was ended up with another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings are so completely different.
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions.
<unk> we took them and we took them so much, that we move away from the people.
And all of the black, we can think that we feel very well, but we're dead in the inside because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and go back to those symbols <unk>
So we do, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we do it to be able to go back and go ahead and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, 30 years ago in the '70s.
architects were busy experimenting with the <unk> <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> little, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we go closer to the '80s, and we started adding those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> again in the other direction.
We took those shapes that we know like and <unk>
<unk> neon and we added some of these new materials.
They love it.
We don't have <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes got <unk> they won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
An madness.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies <unk>
Those fantasies could be to the <unk> to the French or the Italian one.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we use memories of elsewhere.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is <unk>
architects feel frustrated and we started to do the <unk> of new in the other direction.
In the 1980s and the early '90s, we started to experiment with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> the symmetrical symbols now we have with new design techniques -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> some shapes that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> you have totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened to me.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academic academic and public <unk> they were completely agrees on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao went up in a half and when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
The whole world wanted one, and it was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these shapes and wild forms, how is it possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that these shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these ways.
They did it the primary waste of the world.
So everyone believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
So this phenomenon at the beginning of the new year happened with other architects star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few architects of elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go with all of architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how do we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they had to go to the next people to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a ship, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see on the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we all are photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so quick, it's moving.
It's not accurate accurate enough to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years or four years old, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing if the one I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is what we find with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to go back to the <unk> because we are at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture since the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to perform every faster and faster, even to be on both extremes -- almost in <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and your public.
Now we can make some symbols almost <unk> emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk>
It's a vacation.
But it meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like the right box that was done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in the social, the building left of being a building, and it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of a personal narrative -- and it makes it <unk> with the collective memory and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building built today, first of course, <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no single answer to what it can be a library, today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complex drawings and you know, and you know, it's not a <unk> audience that doesn't have seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> of one style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the former city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
So this means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn and not a bad massive imitation of red brick with the base of what it must be an stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will be pushed to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage parking lot in Miami and Florida, it also can serve for sports or <unk> or even one can be married at night.
This means three architects can dream of swimming on the East <unk> in New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the <unk> community around that cause, no one customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> as this little <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to be.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we have.
architects already know how to make more efficient buildings more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we are no longer <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot on play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> world, local libraries -- the homes where we form our kids, and the step of the <unk> to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and it started walking.
And it makes it this typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those great kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
She used all his friends to do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, When I stopped doing this?
How is it that we suddenly are not taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I am <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old.
And as any teenager, you just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
He's preparing for next week, in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells me all the time that her mom tells me all the time that he was beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells me it's ugly.
Among her mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow school, you say, you don't know who I believe.
So it makes a video of her, it does, it puts it on YouTube, and she asks others to leave a <unk> but I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, it has gotten more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal healthy healthy and chaotic <unk> who gets these answers in one of the stages of their more vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are making movies like this, in their majority girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are you doing to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking -- giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We have never been so connected, in a continuous shape, so young people.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
So this environment, to be always connected, it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they have.
There's no division between an online life and real life.
It's really difficult to know the difference between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what it is to be like.
What is the biggest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in one context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now one routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see how young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
And the commodity stars, and the sport, the <unk>
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow healthy and be individuals to be <unk>
But in a culture that is obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of the physical capability, their physical capabilities and other aspects begin to be suffering.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do anything because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how they save society and the field of development development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> of class.
One in five are not attending every time for the days when you're not comfortable with it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look at it well, you see it very well, you know, if you don't think you are thin, you have a lower note to the average of your peers who don't care about that of the appearance.
And this phenomenon has spread across North America and China, and China.
And it turns out, regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be able to make it well, we're talking about how you see it not how you see it.
The low self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
The teenagers with the self-esteem are doing less physical <unk> they eat less fruit and vegetables, they are involved in more diets not healthy that they can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by people around and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all about this for what they make most <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, 70 <unk> surgery to ages and no protection and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they have overweight again, regardless of if they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see them.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is of interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first one is that we have to build confidence in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images, and build their self-esteem.
The good news is there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also an impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first one is the influence of the family, friends and relationships.
These six different aspects are critical points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that will work.
A education is fundamental to this problem needs for each of us to take on each other and be a better model to go through women and girls in our own lives.
Let's defy the current status of the women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not quite beautiful.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not because of how you see them.
So all of us can start doing this to take responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can push people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time I had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as a community governments and companies -- to change our culture, so that our children will grow to be a lot of their own person, to be able to be able to go to your own person, to be the diversity, the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put the people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make a difference in the real world, let's make a difference in the big screen because we only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think you can see never the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in mind?
And his <unk>
And his <unk>
And his <unk>
Her <unk> Her <unk>
It could be just the woman who is at two car seats a distance. What would it mean for her if it was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, who would give him for not having long legs -- <unk> <unk> a <unk> meters.
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this and say, open enough of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is to be <unk>
But we went to our children the truth.
And so that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and as they make us feel.
He pushed the self-esteem of the self-esteem of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of today, they become primary change agents in their own morning.
Let's do it.
The fifth of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went to a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
By <unk> initially they were born, but being prisoner by a prisoner for other charges of others, in others, they started planning to go to about 12 <unk> of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the headquarters at the United Nations.
At luck these plans <unk> by an FBI army.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't be able to afford them.
He later <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
And I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1987, being an engineer <unk> with a <unk> mother school teacher at the age of being done for me a happy child.
Just when I was seven, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims are going to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to work, it doesn't require a lot to be able to look at the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all of human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were so <unk> to their convictions that think you have to use all the possible means for everyone to live like them.
A few months before arrest and he sat with me and explained to me that in the last few week, he and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We arrived at the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me support the <unk> in my shoulder and explained to me how to point to the goal to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot gave up the little light on the goal and, to surprise me, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the rest and in Arabic, said, <unk> <unk>
From such a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people were going to be <unk> to place a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to me 20 times. That instability for my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody -- it was time to pack and go to another city.
As it always was me the new face of the class and I was often <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being white -- but will be the new class of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent in home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't grow social skills, to say it <unk> for growing under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
So I was opera to judge the people, based on indicators of <unk> as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I set to test my way of thinking, was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had made fun was a Jewish age.
I took several days out to the light and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I really felt very proud to be able to overcome the barrier that my whole life had been done to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures, that experience that was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I was able to see that several of them were the smallest and less critical I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat random people, exactly the way I had to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be identical, but I know what is going to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every nights, Jon Stewart asked me to be <unk> to my <unk> and I was helping me to see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my <unk> <unk> in a moment that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in your own.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
He changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is trying to take violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better path.
On the other hand, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to talk against those acts without sense, like rejection to the action of my father.
With this matter, I show you here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race -- that kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that was projected in their minds.
It's an amazing movie <unk>
It's in 3D and it has sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has <unk> taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a moments of your childhood in front of your eyes.
And it has a <unk> voice in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything on it.
This movie is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- you and you and you.
There's nothing to be able to do it more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I don't have certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to do to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
So science -- by nature, it's objective it.
<unk> for nature, it's subjective it.
So there can be no science of consciousness.
Because for nearly all the 20th century -- <unk> that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, neuroscience was studying the <unk> brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for the science of <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real advantage, a <unk> of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the time.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain, and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of wonderful work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces, or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk>
It's not a science of nature.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do in some areas of the brain, and what is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I without offend the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't run the true core mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does it exist?
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon as the <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how they work the <unk> how they are adapted and <unk> the living organisms, all are questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the <unk>
But the hard problem, is the question of why is that all of the behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here's the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that will work for a long time, I would hit the head against the wall, looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that was not working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great, cool -- the physics of chemistry, chemistry explains biology, chemistry explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme in this scheme to fit in.
On one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know yet.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think that we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> to be able to deal with consciousness.
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
The crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions, the behaviors of the brain, and so it works all it needs to be explanation.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to the <unk> that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to it.
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time that we left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explain in terms of anything else.
Instead, they think fundamental -- and that's that the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic events in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts -- time, mass, laws laws -- and I applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws of <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- and space, time, mass, is that by a question of logical -- you have to add the list.
The natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object.
It opens up the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other concepts -- space, the space, the physical processes -- the physical processes.
Now, physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws that we can do in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can put in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everybody, <unk> -- every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, dogs, -- the flies of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of anxiety when you think about the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that the photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> <unk> some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
And in part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental as space and time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal as others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures where the human mind looks more like nature.
A deeper reason it comes from the idea that maybe the simplest and most powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing information, there is consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as a human being, complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple consciousness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of integration integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information embedded in a system.
And they're supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration integration -- a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a half a degree of integration integration as a significant degree of consciousness.
But when you get to the patients -- microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration integration is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there is still a level of consciousness of zero <unk>
Indeed, it led a fundamental law of the high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract ...
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality of the reality underlying the reality underlying the reality.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where are the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
As this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that view, consciousness doesn't find out the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
So this vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have a lot of complex ethical and ethical implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then it must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think we thought about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of <unk> information, she has a processing of complicated information, and so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a lot of serious ethical problems in the ethic of the development of computer computers, and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a local level, a dead group, as the audience in a TED Talk, we have a collective consciousness.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm more secure of the first crazy idea, than consciousness is a fundamental idea, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, like, how do these bits of thinking contribute to the kind of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, so I think we're going to go through the right path to a theory of a serious consciousness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it from night to the morning.
But I think we're going to be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we only need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile of education.
I went to school, I went to me with my friends, I was stuck with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is an obvious problem.
She actually hasn't achieved anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and it was a long time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, it did. How do you know.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing you can consider as a achievement if you take disability out of the equation.
Years later, I'm going to be in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 minutes in the class 11 studies up and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
And I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in wheelchair do talk about <unk> things at all.
Normally in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this boy had had experiences with disability with disability like <unk>
And we don't know that. And it's not the boy, that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there for inspiring.
And in fact, I'm on this stage and I do what I do in this chair, and you probably are waiting for you, right?  Yes.  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you have lied to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something that disability is a <unk> -- a cap <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you a remarkable thing.
It's not a bad thing and you can't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social communication.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one, from the girl without drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn porn -- because I would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> to the people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that one.
But if you're that person else.
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been dealing with strangers -- to express that I think I am a brave or a source of inspiration, and this happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was going to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability on the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
We had some things.
But the things we have is not the things that you have to think about.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately deliberately called the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more of the <unk> because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with it.
So the things I need to do, and I learned how to pull the best of your capacity as well as you do it, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of the common.
They are simply using their bodies to take the best of their own <unk>
So it's really fair to be <unk> in the way we do it, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells us as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of a lie, because we've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- I mean, the inspiration -- and you think, "Oh God, you're not sometimes inspired by something.
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all.
However, I don't think I am more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to collect the things that are over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the battery of the mobile phone on the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance.
I really think that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is that it's not real true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stairs has not done it to become a <unk>
Never.     <unk> on a television display will not show the <unk> for the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the <unk>
I want to live where a 10-year-old girl sitting in her room watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be <unk> for getting up of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where I value the overall achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 degree in a high school school is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
disability doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional reality with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Now unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't be <unk>
When people think they actually think of <unk> they think in <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and cell phone.
So how do we get to the <unk>
The first step is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you have with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the field of play to 160 <unk> the ears.
We can know that it feels like a representative man, we can tell us about trying to stick with all of their being.
I've been there, and I assure you that it's not nice.
<unk> some videos to show what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practice of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment -- I was a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have noticed that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> of Washington.
<unk> de <unk> Mice -- Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling of the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and have been asked in YouTube and in <unk> and you can see from the angle of a field of a field of field.
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh yeah.
No, no, no. I don't want to go <unk> No!
Oh, my God, Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a contemporary mountain <unk> for his life.
What would be the experience of a fan when you put a video from Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of fan of a fan of fan of it.
When I can be <unk> I running the <unk> throwing the ball down into the bottom of the network?
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it would be <unk> the sales sales for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the <unk> <unk>
<unk> the augmented reality of an augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners look at the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a brief review of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to his field of field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to his group and you see your next thing to show you in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have on. You don't have to worry about forget about a <unk>
You have to memorize the strategy.
Just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate <unk>
If you lose messages to you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would have to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people who are bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information you send you to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
bad will have <unk>
So this was going to make good teams of bad guys.
So your team team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being just to be.
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
I would make the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you know, that a defense behind you is going to be <unk> but the system of <unk> you have <unk>
The area of protection.
Another <unk> you know, there's a wide receptor.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees in your bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> public and cartoons have been followed by each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people that you see, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of <unk>
We're going to use only as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use an augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it's literally being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It makes billions of dollars a year.
But how much does this technology make for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad your action from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology worth of technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is also worth a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we make, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was recently inspired by 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
The vast majority of those 23 years I had the country to <unk> the southern tip of the Bertie County that includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to the global view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Laden was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who came up to build the bridge, he said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as a touch -- such that every since he releases it from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that are under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After a free four to five seconds, the body affects water about 120 miles per hour.
The impact breaks bones, some of which would be a life organs.
Most people die in impact.
Those of us who don't don't don't have <unk> in the water, and then it <unk>
I don't think that <unk> this method of suicide will realize the <unk> of death to which they <unk>
This is the cord.
Except, about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people were to take your life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in your darker time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a officer.
I want to tell you with joy we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, international officers and psychologists train to the new land.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 millimeters of last year when I was going to get a phone call of a potential <unk> sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and it had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to here two times before from New Jersey to try <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking with <unk> asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out, <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind and smart boy in New Jersey had just taken your life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day of the family was called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I ask these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved <unk>
What do you want?
<unk> what does it say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk about it, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
You don't have <unk> or you say to the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't know it.
It's just being there, you can be the point of turning that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you won't be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about the end of your life, you've had these <unk>
It would take the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing that things are terrible and they are never going to be able to be able to do -- <unk> believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> social <unk> and a lost of the interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he's with her permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this last week.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home, talk about it to your friends who tell your friends, so on.
I am still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go back home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father on the 19 of January.
He never got there.
He called the police of <unk> and <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and I reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
I had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been able to suffer a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences is with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Golden <unk> is supposed to be a ticket through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and run the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of March 2005, I wrote a call of radio for a possible subject of <unk> on the sidewalk, near the northern tower.
I was going to go through my shirt and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for his account to go back to that lane and give the life another chance.
When Kevin turned to the <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was what he did to <unk> and gave the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of 11 from March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin remains with us.
I think, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like the <unk>
We thank God for you.
debt in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her, she writes -- <unk> When I visited the General of San Francisco at the end of that night -- you would be <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather had <unk>
So that act, even though their own grief, would give me a chance to meet it.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, you wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
Normally this is only three things: sleep, sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've been involved involved in hundreds of mental diseases and called <unk> around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved with just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I was going to take my hand three times.
At the end of it, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people we got to contact with that bridge not <unk>
Moreover, those few people have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second side they leave aside the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge doesn't only connect with <unk> with San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or bridge that we make, is something that every one of us must be used to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There are help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not from, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question: How do you tell you about that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone, in a way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had made the dream I'd had since I was girl.
My outer end is finally in my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, and I think, you know, the <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some have the <unk> value to get rid of the <unk> <unk> of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always defy the status quo that's considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- so many of my neighbors, my even, my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I recorded as a <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the 21st of my house, I always had this shirt in the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing this shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair, I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, in fact, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I would never tell me to share my story, not because I think it's bad, but by how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate to be a woman.
I have mama, Dad and a family who took me like I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something was <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever engaged in the <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in the bathroom, won in <unk> and it was a third <unk> between over 40 candidate <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was a queen of beauty of young women -- but I do do it.
I also met the <unk> <unk> mostly when I went to remote <unk> of the Philippines.
But most importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my application on the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called it and said, "You know if you get to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to listen.
My mom suggested to me to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated surgery -- sophisticated surgeries and safe surgery.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, with the name of <unk> and <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or can get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think about this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who was living in his truth, but that, he was going to be able to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November we make a global <unk> for <unk> Day <unk>
I am on this stage thanks to a long history of people who have <unk> and stood in the face of injustice.
These are Marsha Richard Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the era.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
They'll do it you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you,   <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So thank you first, thank all of my <unk>
I was going to support my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when I was called me and they told me that their parents could not accept it, I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Some times work, other no. It's just one identity identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table the theme that sometimes some times that <unk> not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to do -- and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should be understanding.
It should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thanks. Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies and tribal societies are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for your daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts was released in 2011, the <unk> National <unk> <unk> became very popular -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of the <unk> of violence, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a little girl, your birth is not <unk>
It's not fixed and his father, not for your mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was going to be a lot for a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when you go to her third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only stem mother, but the daughter, <unk> <unk> when it goes up, he has as well.
At the age of five years old, when I should go to school, she stays home and school, including his siblings.
Until the age of 12, in some ways, has a good life.
It can be <unk>
You can play with your friends in the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into your optimism when it grows 13 years ago you get to go from your house, without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turned into the named honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you were going to take the code of that honor, you could even kill.
And it's interesting that this code code, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the droughts of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a more norms of <unk> societies that's called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who must be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and they embrace the decisions of your father and their mother and the decision choices, even if you don't like.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like to like a man who doesn't like to like a man who doesn't like to like it, and if the <unk> with a old man has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what about the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his kids.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I <unk> I thought about his name, and I was fascinated by fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
Her name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so she did.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my feather, and I had a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came up when she was four and a half years ago, the <unk> in my school.
So you may be wondering why I should mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the poor countries, in <unk> societies in tribal societies -- it's a great event for the life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One led to school means it's gone into the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for the future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks before, when you have the form of a tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my writing sisters in no document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all of these good values in my school and children in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
He taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for the rights of women.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political activities, economic and social.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the 10 years, I got up and got up and got up with the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, offered her himself for the New York Times, and I talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
<unk> as a <unk> across the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and October October 2012, was shot to <unk> in the head.
It was a day for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would give me my ear to my <unk> I have <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life on the cause of truth for the cause of peace, and for the cause of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were going to be a lot to me, and I didn't go and ask them again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe pain headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow, which was driven by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile -- and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, and we learned from it how to resist in the hardest moments and I'm pleased to share with you that even though it's an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when I don't just have his task.
He fights their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my party who has done so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
And I was <unk> of the brain, 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering here.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> -- but all the work I'm talking about here on the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
They're still like smart or not?
It doesn't be like this, you can go back to <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how many of a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mixing chemicals out of chemicals -- and try to go to life.
More than I've saved a little bit.
But luckily, I have soul of <unk> so I decided that I <unk> to try to try to get the <unk> dose because it really doesn't have a clear map that tells you in <unk>
I started to try and try different mixes and I was amazed by seeing how little changes in the doses of <unk> my sense of who I am, my way I am, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried dose and chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised by seeing how I <unk> my thinking.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that had in the front, and it just doesn't happen.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience, I gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, since I then carry me better with men.
What I tried to do is how to put those hormones and those hormones and <unk> and so forth, it was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
<unk> to think almost always in pictures, and that became my point of reference <unk> how can I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you have <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Nelson and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who are looking at this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how your mind works, for me, is simple: for most of us, mental images, are fundamental for thinking of <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I was able to find the point right and I've got a lot of great mental <unk> actually <unk> sophisticated and sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring this mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use your imagination just to direct the world to the world that has the <unk>
Or, if a musician, I could extract the music of your mind?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is just to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to coming to this with two recent experiments that have done by two very recent groups that have been conducted by two better groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, electronic MRI imaging -- to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan that was done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you were seeing that same image.
The column on the right is created by <unk> the content of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost old.
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment -- this is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves in <unk> <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube -- while their brains are going to create a great <unk> of brain reactions in the video sequences in the video sequences in the video sequences in the time.
And then I showed you a movie with new images, new new animals, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain information of the scanning to show it to show what the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're very close to doing that.
We only need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and you can imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the <unk> brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution grew as a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you start?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is to open the skull.
I don't give me that one.
A lot of these are new techniques from projection for pictures, even I am, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with magnets that is larger -- but to this point, magnets <unk> it only provides little improvement in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather and larger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures in slightly different ways, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> of clever and bright solutions, and <unk> and <unk> in the places, and <unk> radio systems.
At turn, rather than a magnetic field -- it can be <unk> magnetic patterns -- we have the frequencies of <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the frequencies of radio frequencies -- we can increase a massive form of information that you can extract in a single <unk>
And we can then divide into layers our growing knowledge about the structure of brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity. This is sleep.
We will be able to write our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be convicted of a tool to amplify our thoughts of thinking and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the <unk> of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options that will open this door to it.
But anyway, choose a year or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that I'll take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about this night about coming out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay sense.
I think we all have <unk>
Her <unk> may be saying to some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone who's pregnant, or to tell someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have in your life.
And all I can do is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary by <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that <unk> it's universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> -- I would not be able to go through my records, to quote <unk> <unk>
And I would be slope that by the <unk> of my short <unk> and I had my head <unk> I would have a little boy, "Hey, you're a boy or <unk>
And there would be a uncomfortable silence, at the table.
Take my jaw a little more, I would take my cafe a little bit more, and I would take my coffee.
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother had a stick to his child.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would go through it.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I would have that tough conversation.
So after a couple weeks came again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the <unk> of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a shard of the "Vagina Monologues" that I <unk>
So I would take a profound breath, and I put my eye up and my backs of four years ago with a pink son, staring at what is not a challenge for an <unk> a single girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
So I took a deep step again, I set up <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing to me.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a little boy, but I'm a girl, and I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
OK, I'm more of the kind of girl from a girl with <unk>
And that girl looked at me -- I was paying attention, and said, "My favorite leave is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that's it. I just said, "You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the hardest thing ever ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So many of us, I've been living in some progress in my life, and yes, I often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how you feel living in a <unk>
It's like my <unk> is not different from yours or yours or you.
<unk> I'm going to give you a hundred reasons for why coming out of my <unk> was more difficult to go out of your tea, but this is the <unk> it's not <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared on <unk> it's harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that story is harder than saying to your five years you go to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing -- only the hard.
We have to leave what we have to leave is so hard for what difficult for the other person to make us feel better or worse in terms of our <unk> and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make sense of security, or at least more security than the other side of the door than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I, I had a tail of horse -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the gay gay, they are prepared to fight against any four years to go into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark <unk> <unk> my gay, and the move only a muscle is the hardest ever ever done.
My family my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was turning back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed by so long, but if you don't launch that <unk> you will kill.
One of my <unk> <unk> was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to be gay, and when I do my <unk> <unk> in my black and <unk> truck around the tables and I finally walked around the tables and I finally came around the tables of my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women reported <unk> for Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what's your favorite TV program.
Our favorite program, Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but wait to show your support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband was wearing a <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as they have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to tell where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be true with someone, you have to be prepared for the real thing that you have.
That's how hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the perspective of my perspective -- but understand that what it involves coming out of any of you is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be true.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> you have to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> I just <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you say their parents that maybe you might be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change about.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let me the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You would never get rid of that.
And some can be wounded safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never concerned about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of them will be <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the history of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So next time you find in a dark <unk> <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Good.
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the history of how the intelligence has seen intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that the machine can think of is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can be <unk>
When he goes, <unk> he wrote this as a criticism in the computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I would have a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of the intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a space that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of Earth or intelligence of Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would see to develop a physical theory that explains how to some time in time, the asteroids that would bring the surface of a single planet, they leave the surface.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of the intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through a number of disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be forever adjusted for development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that would support the diversity of possible states.
Finally, in a robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of making complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, for many years ago, there is a mechanism underlying intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the equivalent equivalent of a E = <unk> for intelligence that I saw.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force -- algae that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action -- or keep the open options with a force you, with the diversity of possible accessible, to the diversity of possible accessible, to an impending time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask, "What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes, that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life they should have a tendency to trend conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that <unk> connection between the entropy and the intelligence -- a larger relationship <unk>
What if intelligent behavior is not only measuring with the production of entropy in the long run, but actually emerges directly of it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy entropy in the long run, in whatever system you find in.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal, play games of human beings, and even making money -- <unk> actions, all of it without being able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing up without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
So this ability of balance will have applications for <unk> <unk> and human care.
So this capacity of tools will have applications in smart manufacturing.
Moreover, as some other animals can cooperate throwing off the opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a model of the model of that task.
This capacity for cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning.
<unk> is widely applied to a variety of <unk>
For example, we see it successfully playing a <unk> game, <unk> its potential for the game.
So here we see here we can pull together new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly getting up and keeps the very successful network.
This is the same <unk> capacity also in terms of health care.
So here we see <unk> organize the routes of a chicken fleet discovering success and using the Panama researchers to expand its scope from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applied to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a series of <unk> of <unk> <unk> by increasing assets under their exponentially.
This risk risk will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walk upright and social, all flow from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term the term -- the <unk> work, there was always the concept that if you have a smart machines -- there would be a protective rebellion, there would be a <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion, and we had the other way of the rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart.
It's all the other thing that the impulse to take control of all the possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that intelligence can actually actually emerge directly from taking control instead of being the way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
People often ask me, how do you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help us build artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence -- it's this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions on their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a turning point in human history, something between the captain of stars, and losing the planet we call <unk>
Even over the last years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The NASA NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is points that Earth is only one between the billions of planets from our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space Telescope which measures the weak gravitational intensity of stars, when planets go ahead of them, and block a little bit of that light that will go.
Data collected by Kepler showing the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their star star
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small, and <unk> like the planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that are receiving their <unk>
At turn, this gives tracks about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this refrigerator of potentially <unk> worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest record.
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us from a couple of years ago, they're now disappearing for decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused by a global scale of a global scale, and we will move our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a science scientist, I don't have <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the influenced by stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to find life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for aliens opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds, invites a comparison between the entire planet, and the planets that we know better, our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite a little further away from the sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, shown this by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> they track its surface to search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that the <unk> as the <unk> mission -- take samples from the atmosphere of <unk> and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies are providing not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, we can remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are attached to our imagination with the <unk> and <unk> ideas with Earth, Mars is a pretty awful place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain by <unk> places that are really <unk> with Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places out of the Earth -- the air is cool and full of oxygen.
So I worry that this excitement for the power of Mars and other planets will stick with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars will expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet we know that it's truly habitable in the Earth.
So I like the exploration exploration -- I'm in deep disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to bring humanity to humanity -- it's like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will argue that the party of the Titanic will come up later on the <unk> boats --  Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep into <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> and land and the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, nuclear Enrico Fermi asked me, having to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become really advanced enough to consider to be living in living between stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that we have to protect the planets of the planets that we have to make this development.
It's <unk> to think that we only have to be able to save ourselves of ourselves, but physical preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to replace the emerging environments of Mars for the human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I cut my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the table table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it made cold.
I could not go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I would take my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> to half night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, living room.
I'm a <unk> a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases your heart rate, and we have the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the <unk> counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in the place, that would be a little bit of bad things.
Or, at least, if bad things are bad things, which is the probability that is a complete catastrophe of it.
So I got to think about that, but even a month later, my thoughts were <unk>
I was dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and, I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called the hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and trying to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and try to find out all the things that might go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to avoid the things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in a form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so successfully.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
So in the house, I would have a place for the things that are very easily.
This sounds common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish are, that the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find your nuts.
And if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and you still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car reading and <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for keys, a hook along the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport.
For your reading reading -- a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they are <unk> with that -- your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the phone a picture of your credit credit card credit card -- passport.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you are under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the better time, and you have to put the systems into the site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that condition, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or a loved being, to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making choices, and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision you have to take a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of diseases -- <unk> heart attack, heart disease.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the better, then the doctor says, "I would like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> medications in the world today, it's probably likely to know people than the <unk>
So you say, "Yeah, you say, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do so, a statistic that you should ask for most doctors don't want to speak and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to try.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or send surgery into any medical procedure before you help a person.
And it must think about what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor doesn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's someone, it's from scientists like me.
We have not understood very well the <unk>
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs work only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help someone else.
300.
This is according to the research of <unk> researchers -- <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the medicine for a year before avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you're going to say, "Well, one chance on 300 of my <unk>
Why don't not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody else.
But then you have to ask for a larger statistic -- and it is, <unk> of <unk>
For this particular medicine, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And these include <unk> <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're like, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, even take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how we do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drugs that help you the drug.
I'm not saying they had to take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is, it's part of the first informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of <unk> but actually this number necessary to treat it quite typical.
For the surgery that is most done in the older men of 50, <unk> of prostate for cancer, the number necessary to deal with <unk>
So it is, 49 surgery for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the jokes. or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have luck and it's one of that 50 percent effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can make that <unk> conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that I could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change from opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is to turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face on the face of a predatory system, you don't have the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react to the water, so none of it matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought -- rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have ever been.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail instead of time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put the systems into the place that will help you to minimize the harm, or to avoid the bad things in the first place.
I set up at the night of snow in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key door to the front door in the same one form of it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very excited, but I see organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical signal.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there it looks like it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, never <unk> a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came across the middle decade and over the time of time, it mixed with local signals, and it was developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for anything.
Sound are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's as if I lived in a foreign country in a foreign country on their own rules, <unk> behaviors and norms.
So how do I understand the sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example.
"I don't make the <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of <unk>
"I don't know -- and when you're eating, make sure you don't have <unk> <unk>
All of this is called <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that is going to come to next.
From there, this picture.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to move on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to make my thumb so this doesn't feel natural.
That's why I had four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there were no visual art there.
At that time, sound was the trend and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has gone into my territory of art.
I'm going to make me more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything I had taught me as the sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new body body.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention that I have.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a person <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that I could go back to me and my artistic job, or I might be <unk>
I chose to choose that I <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eye of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in the present society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, to <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value, something like taking a loan down a loan to a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue with this practice, I feel like I could do it in <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new art, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be able to capture and express out on the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning of signals as the sound of sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor of the piano to understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters -- different <unk>
If you take a different <unk> for each finger while you touch the piano as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while the piano, English is a linear language.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need 10 fingers, you need 10 fingers to express a very clear idea or an idea in <unk>
If you only would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal, in that."
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you doing?"
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and I look at the <unk> through your ears.
If I had to create a sign and you would take it over and over again, it could be a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out, and it gets off.
This is <unk>
If you look at it, and you take the speed, visually and you see it as a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same thing can say about <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance into your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> -- it's a hand, two <unk> -- it's two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Take a look at <unk> hand.
We have <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the language languages around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this -- please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one, please take it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all occur in the head and the chest. But they made very different meanings together.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> is alive and successful, like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have a social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich deforestation, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to start to open your ears, open up the eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "Can you make it all, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these beautiful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I have to say, because the adults would lie to protect us from the awful truth.
When I became older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the others.
The time happened, now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with piles of waste.
So as a good citizens, we have the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's a little bit creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and this information on a map.
But it takes an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive and it's also very expensive to use these huge boats together.
So along with my students, with ages ages of six to 15 years, dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our little tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a <unk>
So we started building this <unk> <unk> so that children are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you, children who manipulate electrical tools make great electrical tools.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size we find in the size we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> in something we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot of a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children are getting a lot with robots.
Then we created what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and web cameras, and it <unk> it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is just captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on onboard process process this image and measure the size of each other, to get an estimate of plastic in the water.
So let's take this step step back on a website to inventors called <unk> with hope that someone would do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to move it right away.
I investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this nature.
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning up a oil spill -- just using your hands, in <unk> the world's largest world's largest forest.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where the water is, where they live.
You can see also the water is brown and oil and oil and oil are also brown color, and when it comes together, it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different ideas, which can help you identify what's in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was researching a problem to <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a hardest problem.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that mattered several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> were destroyed a lot of cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of JPL, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, according to an average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of all, it has safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the accident and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course I don't <unk> the parents not <unk>
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem not to take the serious work, but they did do it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we talk about the data that day, and we talk about what we were going to do later, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> oh.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the closest to the date.
We are approaching up to 1.5 miles of nuclear headquarters and with the <unk> of fishermen in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a little baby of sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit like this, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space of social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with adult aid, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or, we can help in the mobility of the age of life transforming their standard wheels chairs in new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So human citizens scientists, creators -- we have to make the next generation to be concerned with the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures <unk>
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic <unk>
One will imposes over the environment, the other one.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the lawn <unk> he saw a figure that is being free.
The <unk> was only a kind of tool.
But life are not <unk>
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that was required by every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production of mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world that was made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained people to think about their objects like <unk> of different parts of <unk> different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You acts primarily to filter the other primarily as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no parts, there are no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through <unk>
Here's a divided display that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect at work now between the <unk> and the gene, between the <unk> and the growth, between Henry Ford Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere, analysis and synthetic analysis of the two screens behind me.
My work, in its simpler level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from the <unk> and go to the growth.
You probably ask why now?
Why did it not be possible about 10 years ago.
We live in a very special moment in history -- a rare moment where you have four disciplines that provides four disciplines that offers designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm, with a scope of 24 feet in diameter that someday not very far print <unk> buildings to print the <unk> and online buildings made from genetically <unk> that shine the dark.
So here we have <unk> <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where each other. is size to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> <unk> in Paris with <unk> they're like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D collaborator -- we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> with no seams between cells. I'm going to show more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution high-tech development, and the <unk> instruments. It allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the time, comfortable and also absorbed sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> becomes <unk>
We have this surface of 44 different properties -- which vary in <unk> -- <unk> color, and color, and color points in the human body.
Her surface, as in nature, changes their functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me stories about the Bible Bible, and one of them got me and define a lot of what matters.
As she goes, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth down to the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of it.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk>
The land created a world that's made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design if the objects were made of a single piece of them.
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the tree of <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons produced every year for organisms as shrimp, or <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we can tune their properties, we could make a <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures at a large scale, it built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material on the march, and create these made these made these made of a single billion material for long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are <unk> it leaves them to find a natural form in contact with the air.
So why are we going to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process, they used to be used to have <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition that they make their transition with no problems of exposed <unk> and if it expanded even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of carbon <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for objects that are designed for <unk> at the sea, and the lives of <unk> and placed on the ground, they will grow a tree.
It fits for our next exploration of the same design principles -- the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we have to dominate the bacteria and control them.
So as the <unk> <unk> we made our own own <unk> table, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology, like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- new symmetrical models inside of very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first one is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the <unk> water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacterium that <unk> in the human brain.
A convert light into sugar, the other carbon sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two vehicles don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we've created a single channel.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted to have more <unk> <unk> more transparent.
So this system lies <unk> when it stretches from one end to each other, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> bright channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are a long fashion creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create a personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the frozen tissue and we have our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So right now, you know that a 3D printer reverse material.
It also knows that nature doesn't do it like that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which is <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers together.
And this goes through scales.
The silk worm is turned on in the environment, creates a tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside of a box with <unk> sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk> of <unk>
However, when you place the silk worm in a flat, flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we had a cocoon and a plan -- and still <unk>
So we started to design different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that shape, the shape, the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death within the death of their <unk> its silk.
We saw that designing these galleries -- we can shape the <unk> silk form of <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> <unk> and we put it into our site.
We knew that the <unk> silk worms are going to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, sends the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We were <unk> silk worms to an online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put it very carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and while you have <unk> <unk> and life begins again, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
The biological silk of biological silk on <unk> silk -- they give all this <unk>
And in a little more than two or three weeks -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty <unk>
If the last edge of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form a ecology, of two materials -- designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which leads to it around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that leads to a design inspired by nature inspired by nature inspired by nature that demands us, for the first time, which we can take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if your question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, and the art and I had the art and the art and I was able to read the guitar in a stone band named <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I generally like to test and persist in anyway, for having a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I'm going to make me a little bit of something -- something totally different, and I was going to go into it, and I let you absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to take it on.
But then I'd like to find something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern led me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I was not sure what I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, the whole of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why caused me so much anxiety was a little more staff.
I was concerned that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was concerned about having a fear of engagement, or to make it wrong or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I would like to ask you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where we did that in the culture.
So we ask ourselves to first say, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one care about what I would take to that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question makes us over and over again, as a lot of different forms, <unk> high school students are asked to pick up college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It is going to be the beautiful exercise of being the nice thing to take away sleep.
Why?
So if this question inspired children to dream with what they might be, it doesn't inspire to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does anything, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though adults are <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of <unk> turned into <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But most children don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But that's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the destiny or the true <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that show their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a target.
And feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if it's divide in three <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
You can also be able to use other terms that we have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> whatever term you like or your own one, your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned talking about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths in the way that it looks like.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> -- <unk> his shared interests in the open-source visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, to <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this single idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at the intersections.
From there new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these <unk> <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is really quickly.
When the <unk> are interested in it, we're going to do that.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> for being a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that <unk> so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a young girl, "You have an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he turned to a writer, <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the fine sales mechanics when he was starting his thumb, and this skill helps him write compelling the compelling terms for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to be able to get it to what you would do -- even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk>
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the CEO of videos, other designer designer -- sometimes consultant for a <unk> sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take various <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Magazine Magazine defined adaptability as the most important skill for development to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly, and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market that really <unk>
<unk> ideas, rapid learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a huge interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need a lot of creative creative systems to cope with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> provides a span of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are <unk> with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them they were told to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once he said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> in inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart doctor, so if you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best you do.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I said, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep their curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
I would use the intersections.
It leads to the inner life of an internal and happy life.
And maybe most importantly, we have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year he went to a woman named <unk> he led to a psychiatric psychiatric psychiatric psychiatric disorder.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of his life.
Her doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but it would be <unk> for it until unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange and <unk> <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen.
The most surprising thing.
If you would have been living alive today, we could not give it a little bit more helps to give it a little bit more aid than the <unk> gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced <unk>
There are antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But there's little progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimers now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to be involved with many of you.
If you wait to live to the 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's is to be almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their years with Alzheimer's -- with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's.
Just in America, Alzheimer's costs costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is done in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs of five times in the year by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's made relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the world's first causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be able to be able to cure or even slow back.
We understand less than Alzheimer's other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a greater cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but the whole world, Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For the most part of the last <unk> years, all of all, the scientists, diseases with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there is only to look at a picture of a healthy brain, healthy compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to making a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of the dots are happening to the outside.
So this makes the protein molecules going into each other, forming groups that can be large <unk> and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and the identification on what step is complex as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the <unk>
You have to find the right step that we do -- and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, it has reduced the wires down the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people -- doctors, doctors, biologists, physical chemicals -- physical engineers -- physical engineers and God.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'm going to show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some of the videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normal.
These convergence, on the other hand, have protein molecules that are <unk> each other inside them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at the early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome -- but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that can understand and fix.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope about what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to make sure that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move into the treatment of HIV at the end of the 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And his families, the hidden versions of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> which cannot create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times and New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience to prove it one night of last summer myself.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers were going to be <unk> to become 36 questions more and more personal and then both you look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> if you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or ability, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time we had someone else.
And <unk>
<unk> that are <unk> these are increasingly personal staff.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner -- what you like to do or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really kind of detail really called me attention, was that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this studio, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But I think it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send myself a few months later.
That was published in <unk> and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you might probably be wondering:
And the reason I think about this is because I've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before I was published the article very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been told to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog sport can go to some hundreds of views like a lot, and these were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times will be probably some thousands of view.
And that came a good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night and since Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday had been called the argument -- Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got more than eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing with <unk> on <unk> experience, but another thing is to find out that life is a really international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called the <unk> they did every day for weeks -- always, they did first the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on the radio and <unk>
Even gave a talk, and a woman hears the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got myself red.
So I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper -- you should wait for people to sit comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times was published a <unk> article for St. <unk> who included the experiences of readers at the test of them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both were doing a public onset together.
<unk> interviews of TV, and <unk> the photos of pictures of us two.
I think that I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if I really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love -- not only an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, most of all, that people said the wrong question.
How do we know if you go together, or not, and you can do it.
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal students among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It sounds romantic here.
But study it worked.
The participants felt closer to doing it, and a lot of studies, then used the <unk> protocol, <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating confidence and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they used it to be used between people of the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me, <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He looked like <unk>
And I said, you know, you want to say that you get rid of the person who are <unk>
Well he did a break.
I think she only wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that I did have to know better after the <unk>
The <unk>
So <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to do all my entire adult life, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I became the science.
And so everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hope that it could be in a kind of <unk> way to the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just did for the book that I wrote -- but in hindsight, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was <unk> with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used to be felt like I sat down then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in a way or another way.
I am more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I am.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably I can demand me.
So what I'm looking for love is an artist, not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to be <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wonder when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media talked about about 36 questions is that there may be a cut for <unk>
There may be a form for some ways to mitigate something of the risk of <unk> and this is a very scary story, because they love us feeling <unk> but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that asks, still follow together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who you deserve your love and who isn't it?
How are you going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they are a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a met and I applied a designed study to create romantic love -- we still continue together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love -- it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happened.
<unk> farmers, because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it right now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I was not considered everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think it was how many of them would have to take that decision, and how much of it will have to be able to do that choice without knowing before he will always choose or not.
I want it to be enough and responded to 36 questions, and I have chosen to love somebody so generous, and fun and they expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of truth.
And what I'm going to do is, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I actually did not actually written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he will also love me, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lot of mountain <unk> and in some way I got a <unk> of the forest.
Something really affected me to the city of New York -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a bill of a dollar, a pen and a fork in some place in Colorado.
And I thought that some strangers or a certain aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species had <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
In a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from field and <unk> and all those things -- and I was doing a little bit of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I plucked all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> and I made a kind of <unk> and I made a kind of a <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added a little bit closer on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, what happened, in some way it seemed that it went up of size, as if it was that I <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add electronic elements, strange bottles that was going to find out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for my whole life, trying to make a lot of these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
And I can flow out by drawing -- drawing the same as a little bit of a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects out, and I created my own cookie, <unk>
First, I'm going to be able to get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun drawing on the <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point, I got interested in the human shape, sculptures of how much natural enough of human beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the letting me kill.
And I was going to go to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to drawing on a window, then in another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that were a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really work, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my piece of <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by great measure in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk>
<unk> feet long.
It's twice a face, so they're 10 feet old.
It's a bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood it.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with head of animals travel between two worlds.
You go out of the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with head animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a bird God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of rare things that can be found if you look very well at the ocean.
But anyway, a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it puts oil in a hand while in the other hand, you get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> as a bird <unk> and it causes the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> feet long, an snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
Her tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made from al 1986.
<unk>
They did in the 1980s -- as if they were baseball cards for terrorists.
And it leads me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in form of human being, and travel in 20, 20, four or 12, at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human <unk> inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That is the <unk> is the chest, you can break it down.
I'm going to play them for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that goes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it does, you have a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that go out and go into the head of this weird statue coming in.
There's a small forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
But anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This leads to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
And within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a writer, a museum, a museum, an editorial arm, which spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
They put the box and all the people in inside each other as particles.
And I think that's how to change the world.
When you have <unk> who is and the box that you're living on.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, in the borders, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all really made of the same matter, and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
And I'll take a pill -- it's the most effective system and the most effective system, so that whatever drug is happening in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> whatever drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are required to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and you will increase the driver of stem cells.
But they are also known by their side effects in their side effects, because in the time that it takes to get to the open day, it would be <unk> and worse through the time that it takes to your fate, which is where it's more important, which is where it is more important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body as the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood of the patients that would be attached to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
So this is the great problem of HIV treatment with current drugs that is a treatment of life run by oral life.
One day, I sat and I thought, "Let's do the treatment of treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use <unk> to care of wounds and surgery.
In fact, we are using pulses of laser to open or <unk> extremely small, open holes -- that opens up and immediately immediately immediately the cells are infected with HIV to put drugs with HIV to put drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a laser and potent laser <unk> on the living cellular membrane by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug to a matter of time.
Before I even noticed, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser -- we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site of infection.
And finally, the third head, a <unk> that changes, the drug, it releases it directly on the site of infection, while the laser is used to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to HIV total of HIV from the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researchers in the <unk> in our case, a treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups -- not <unk> organizations like terrorists, or <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they are not shoot them.
My goal is to understand better to these factors of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition of violent participation to the violent <unk>
I do research work, in the world of politics and the library.
To understand these groups is a key to solve almost all of these conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be an argument between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and government soldiers.
For example, from the <unk> arrangements of peace, between 1975, and 2011, we signed up between a state and an actor,
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what drives these organizations.
And we know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't go to it.
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the decade of 1980, <unk> has also set a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks, it also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're investment.
<unk> a complex machine from communication stations radio stations channels on TV, websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but by <unk> business for example, <unk>
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their <unk> to increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups are also doing something else, create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put in a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Iraq Afghanistan, by the war or even the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> can be understood also the efforts of these groups for getting security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price increased dollars for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election of 2006 is the Palestinian wolf can't be understood without recognizing the social job.
It's a really complex stage -- even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps for government, and emerge like armed groups and politicians, they participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can use it as some contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run up all of your <unk> collect the waste, run the <unk> system.
Is it a state? It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations without been, and the more weak ones are states, as in the Middle <unk> and the top of that gap is more dependent on it, and they fill that gap into government soldiers.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
It has that government void has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and bring the peace.
If we understand better to groups -- we will understand better what incentives to provide the transition of violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors did not have the military power to be able to make a few <unk> but not giving us peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that government empty that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist guy.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm replicated but quite bad.
And therefore I became a bad feminist feminist man.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on the interviews, people started calling the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, same and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me step back.
When I was young, about everything in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women were <unk> with the men and <unk> -- as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to the <unk> that could be feminist at the time.
It's going to be labeled as feminist as a <unk> and a word <unk> and <unk>
I was amazed as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who is asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe it's equal to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, replicated and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as the free of <unk> or violence.
We have right to be able to use it and accessible the birth and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without need for <unk> for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition, skills, and so much more.
We have to have in account of these differences and how we get rid of the same way that matters in common.
Without this type of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be <unk> I'm a mess.
I'm full of mine.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist man.
I have another confession.
When I drive into work, I hear rap music to all volume.
Although the letter shifts to the women, and it removes me deep down, the classic <unk> <unk> of yang yang <unk> is unbelievable.
<unk> reality with your shirt ...
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical characters.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do -- <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of the grass and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and good stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I think that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they go to it.
So let's take this problem.
And the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women color, the gay workers, gay women -- and <unk> and <unk> women -- <unk> and high middle class.
See, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist man.
It also happens as this: As a hammer I feel much pressure.
We have this trend of putting <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will be <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think of that <unk> before I try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, have a fear of being tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of getting standing up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag is afraid of fear of not being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it with a realistic <unk>
Take the example of <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years is a feminist feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to this star of pop embrace openly feminism and knowing women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
By the time, the cultural critics started with endless arguments if it was -- it was or not just feminist things.
It would look at her, rather than simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection -- because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much -- we need so much.
So we're going to be much beyond the sane criticism of <unk> and <unk> to give up the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Whatever it was, well, one more inclusive feminism is the point.
But what's next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, and to be a little more brave.
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide an environmental supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> change actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when the bad decisions are allowed to do this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality equality that we all deserve and it's our responsibility.
I think in my <unk> three and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
So where they are amazed by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as a much easier.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating the sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change radio <unk> when we heard songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the movie in another part when the movies are not treating women as though they are <unk>
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes are treating their classmates as <unk>
In any case men, especially young men, heterosexual guys can say, "No, I'm not going to go to put in your magazine, to participate in their project, or to work with you, until it doesn't bring a long number of women to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of <unk>
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also <unk> it to be including as much more than us to be able to do it to the walls of the decision.
Since we are not <unk> but we don't have to adopt these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will go to the top, to people in the power of directors and music producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also say with bravery for us, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it a incident to cope with what happened.
A few children would tell me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I did not think I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was amazed at a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned writing like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what we can measure.
Through the script and of life, I also found that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear and see me and realize that none of us is anything that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have a sense that I'm only a woman.
I'm a bad bet. I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be a little bit courageous, when you need to be <unk>
It's just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune system, which is one of the most easily dying diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than a century ago, but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents had a fear of something that was supposed to be <unk>
But a moment -- it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines -- and that is made up and made up by an Italian fraud by British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most smart scientists than the theory of vaccine cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know that most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians that I had heard about to develop all of his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence continued only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could make it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you question the people of the Center for disease Center for Atlanta -- what's going on, they tend to based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis and a better <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language don't completely <unk> the fears of a young mother who searches in the face of his son, the visual eye.
If the criteria criteria had to be <unk> why they were so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to have less to do with the slow progress of the science of the science of the <unk>
For most of the 20th century, the doctors were told a story about what autism and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second most accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed <unk> worlds a private worlds, pushed people around them, even their own parents.
You could be fun for hours by shaking the hands in their faces, but they were <unk> of panic by <unk> as when you don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the decade of 1950, as a primary authority of the world in the subject, I declared that I had seen less than 150 real cases of his syndrome while I had a references of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, let's give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but we now know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
One time I realized that he turned to nine out of every 10 children sent for other doctors to his office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of blood disease, they caused by cold, and <unk>
These kids, he said, have kept very careful in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were just <unk> what they heard their parents -- desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible for the world in general.
surprisingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> public psychologist in London, thought that the theory of moms <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had an autistic autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how difficult it was to raise a girl like Susie! No education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis without a diagnosis of it.
To stand at the National Development Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years earlier.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the overall population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse the reality.
Some children could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with their fascination in dinosaurs, or in the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit in nice squares and <unk> like <unk> and you saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had ever noticed these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the year next to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I stopped <unk> <unk> in his own work.
I had not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German -- and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who was leading a clinic integrated with a dream school in Kenya.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in your clinic started with kinds of exercises with music, and children followed their games on the evening.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients as patients called them their little teachers, and he became going to help in the development of education that were particularly nice for them.
<unk> saw autism as a wide diverse flowing that threatens an amazing variety of creature, and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common and always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as the <unk> social scientist, and the teacher <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and the early '90s, their changes were <unk> by <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a wide and <unk>
These changes don't fell in the broken bag.
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked on the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> -- like <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> by a <unk> of the world knew what autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical evidence to use to diagnose autism.
It doesn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for your child.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a web effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> actually hoping that it was, making people with autism and their families will finally support the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the increase in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart center that one of every 68 children in the U.S. are in the spectrum, are right, the autistic are one of the world's largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people autistic have been attached to the Internet to refuse the idea that the puzzles is to solve for the new advances of doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
A way of understanding <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, it doesn't mean it's <unk>
As the <unk> standards -- the normal human brain is easily easily <unk> social <unk> and he suffers from a attention to the details.
Indeed, people autistic have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> which creates <unk> for the <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capability, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their kids.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once once said, "We need all the hands on the cover of the <unk>
As you go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to cope with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to be wasting a brain.
Thank you.
